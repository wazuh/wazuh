brief: A Wazuh cluster is a group of Wazuh managers that work together to enhance the availability
       and scalability of the service. These tests will check the agent enrollment in a multi-server
       environment and how the agent manages the connections to the servers depending on their status.

    assertions:
        - Agent without keys. Verify that all servers will refuse the connection to the 'wazuh-remoted' daemon
          but will accept enrollment. The agent should try to connect and enroll each of them.
        - Agent without keys. Verify that the first server only has enrollment available, and the third server
          only has the 'wazuh-remoted' daemon available. The agent should enroll in the first server and
          connect to the third one.
        - Agent without keys. Verify that the agent should enroll and connect to the first server, and then
          the first server will disconnect. The agent should connect to the second server with the same key.
        - Agent without keys. Verify that the agent should enroll and connect to the first server, and then
          the first server will disconnect. The agent should try to enroll in the first server again,
          and then after failure, move to the second server and connect.
        - Agent with keys. Verify that the agent should enroll and connect to the last server.
        - Agent with keys. Verify that the first server is available, but it disconnects, and the second and
          third servers are not responding. The agent on disconnection should try the second and third servers
          and go back finally to the first server.
