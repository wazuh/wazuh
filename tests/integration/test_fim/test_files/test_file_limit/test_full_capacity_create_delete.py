brief: File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system watches selected files and triggering alerts when these
       files are modified. In particular, these tests will check if FIM events are still generated when
       a monitored directory is deleted and created again.
       The FIM capability is managed by the 'wazuh-syscheckd' daemon, which checks configured files
       for changes to the checksums, permissions, and ownership.

pytest_args:
    - fim_mode:
        realtime: Enable real-time monitoring on Linux (using the 'inotify' system calls) and Windows systems.
        whodata: Implies real-time monitoring but adding the 'who-data' information.
    - tier:
        0: Only level 0 tests are performed, they check basic functionalities and are quick to perform.
        1: Only level 1 tests are performed, they check functionalities of medium complexity.
        2: Only level 2 tests are performed, they check advanced functionalities and are slow to perform.

    description: Check if a testing file is not inserted in the FIM database when the maximum monitored
                 files limit has already been reached, and if the FIM event 'delete' is generated when
                 an already monitored file is deleted. For this purpose, the test will monitor a directory
                 and fill it with several test files until the maximum limit of monitored files is reached.
                 Then, it will create a testfile and wait for no FIM events to be generated. Finally,
                 it will delete the already monitored files and verify the 'deleted' FIM event is raised.
