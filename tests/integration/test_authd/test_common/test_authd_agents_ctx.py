type: integration

brief: These tests will check if the 'wazuh-authd' daemon correctly handles the enrollment requests
       from agents with pre-existing IP addresses or names. The 'wazuh-authd' daemon can automatically
       add a Wazuh agent to a Wazuh manager and provide the key to the agent.
