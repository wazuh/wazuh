type: integration

brief: These tests will check if the 'wazuh-authd' daemon correctly handles the enrollment requests,
       generating consistent responses to the requests received on its IP v4 network socket.
       The 'wazuh-authd' daemon can automatically add a Wazuh agent to a Wazuh manager and provide
       the key to the agent.

        Checks if when the `wazuh-authd` daemon receives different types of enrollment requests,
        it responds appropriately to them. In this case, the enrollment requests are sent to
        an IP v4 network socket.
