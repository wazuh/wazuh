brief: These tests will check if the 'max_upload_size' setting of the API is working properly.
       This setting allows specifying the size limit of the request body for the API to process.
       The Wazuh API is an open source 'RESTful' API that allows for interaction with
       the Wazuh manager from a web browser, command line tool like 'cURL' or any script
       or program that can make web requests.
