title: Wazuh Docker Listener Integration

overview: |
  This integration receives, parses and processes logs obtained with the docker-listener wodle from docker. This are real-time events from the docker server.

  Docker events can be of different types:
  * Containers
  * Images
  * Plugins
  * Volumes
  * Networks
  * Daemons
  * Services
  * Nodes
  * Secrets
  * Configs

  Each one of them having they're own event status and fields.
  More details of this fields [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events/).

  This events are received and forwarded directly with the docker-listener wodle.
  More information on how to use and a example on how to achieve this [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/proof-of-concept-guide/monitoring-docker.html).

compatibility: >
  This module has been tested against docker version 24.0.2 wazuh agent 4.4.3 in ubuntu 22

configuration: |
  Docker-listener wodle can be configured and set on the manager or the agent, depending on where is docker used.
  The default configuration sets:
   * _interval_ to 1m: This is the waiting time to rerun the wodle in case it fails.
   * _attempts_ to 5: Number of attempts to execute the wodle.
   * _run_on_start_ to yes: Run command immediately when service is started.

  More information on each configuration field [here](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/reference/ossec-conf/wodle-docker.html).

  ```xml
  <wodle name="docker-listener">
