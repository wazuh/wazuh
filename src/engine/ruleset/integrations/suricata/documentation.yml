overview: |
  This integration supports [Suricata](https://suricata.io//) open source network analysis and threat detection software (configuration details for
  different operating systems can be changed, more information in the configuration section).

  This integration takes into account the alerts generated by Suricata in versions higher than 6.x. There will be many other logs from suricata that won't be taken into account in this integration version.

compatibility: The integration was tested with suricata alert logs from version 6.0.0.
configuration: |
  This integration ingests suricata alerts in JSON format from eve.json file. This is default output file for suricata systems. All linux platforms uses /var/log/suricata folder as log location, windows instalation may vary, and user will need to specify the right path. 

  Adding to the ossec.conf file in the monitored agent the following blocks depending on your platform:
    
  Linux rpm and deb systems:
    
  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <!-- Edit location to appropriate path if needed -->
    <location>/var/log/suricata/eve.json</location>
    <log_format>json</log_format>
  </localfile>
  ```

  windows systems:

  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <log_format>json</log_format>
    <location>WINDOWS_PATH\eve.json</location>
  </localfile>
  ```
