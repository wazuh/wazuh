title: Wazuh dashboard integration

overview: |
  Wazuh dashboard module is designed to collect, parse, and analyze logs generated by [Wazuh dashboard](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/user-manual/wazuh-dashboard/index.html), offering insights into the operation and performance of the server.
  By effectively processing these logs, Wazuh dashboard module serves as a powerful tool for administrators to monitor server performance, diagnose issues, and optimize operations.

compatibility: The integration was tested with Wazuh dashboard logs from version 4.4.

configuration: |
  This integration uses the logcollector source localfile to ingest the logs from `/var/log/syslog` (the location of the files can be configured in the localfile configuration).
  Adding to the manager ossec.conf file the following block:

  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    <location>/var/log/syslog</location>
  </localfile>
  ```
  Note: Wazuh dashboard integration depends on syslog integration. Therefore, this integration must be previously added to the engine.
