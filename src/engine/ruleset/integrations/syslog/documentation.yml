title: Syslog Integration
overview: >
  This integration processes logs with Syslog RFC 3164 format. By default, `/var/log/auth.log`, `/var/log/syslog/`,
  `/var/log/dpkg.log` and `/var/log/kern.log` files are read but it can be extended to any syslog-formatted inputs.
compatibility: >
  This integration allows ingesting logs that are formatted as specified in the Syslog RFC 3164 standard.
  Please, see https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3164.txt.
configuration: >
  For example, a localfile can be added to the `ossec.conf` file in a monitored agent as in the following block:

  ```xml
  <localfile>
    <!-- Edit location to appropriate path if needed -->
    <location>/tmp/syslog_formatted.log</location>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
  </localfile>
  ```

event:
  module: syslog
  dataset: syslog.log
