  description: |
    The function `int_calculate` performs basic arithmetic operations on integers.
    The function receives an operator and two or more operands.
    The function applies the operator to the first two operands and then applies the result to the next operand.
    The result of the operation is stored in the field `field`.
    The function supports the following operators: `sum` (addition), `sub` (subtraction), `mul` (multiplication), and `div` (division).
  keywords:
    - math

helper_type: map

is_variadic: True

arguments:
  operator:
    type: string  # Accept only string
    source: value # Includes values or references (their names start with $)
    generate: string
    restrictions:
      allowed:
        - mul
        - div
        - sub
        - sum
  operand_left:
    type: number # Accept only object
    generate: integer
    source: both # Includes only values
  operand_right:
    type: number # Accept only object
    generate: integer
    source: both # Includes only values

skipped:
  - different_type
  - success_cases # the generator can generate a 0 in the numerator

general_restrictions:
  - arguments:
      operator: div
      operand_right: 0
    details: Division by zero is not allowed (the function will fail).
  - details: The limit for a 64-bit integer is 2^63-1 and -2^63.

output:
  type: number
