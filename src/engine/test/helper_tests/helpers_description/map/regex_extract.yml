    Match and capture the regex expression against the indicated "fieldToMatch", saving the captured group in field.
    Save in field the captured group if the regex expression matches, otherwise if "fieldToMatch"
    is not found or is not of type string, or if the regex did not match, nothing is performed.
    If the operation executes successfully the field is overridden, if it does not exist, it is created.
    Keep in mind that we need to escape reserved Yaml characters depending on the string input mode of Yaml.
