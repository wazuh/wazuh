# Name of the helper function
name: array_append

metadata:
  description: |
    Adds the values or references of any Json type to the target array field.
    This helper function is normally used in the map stage.
    If the target field exists and is not an array it will be overridden, if it does not exist it will be created.
    Currently this operations will fails as soon as one reference parameter is not found.
    As it is an array, only elements of the same type can be added.
    The type of the first element contained in the array will always be taken or, failing that, the type of the first
    element to be added.
