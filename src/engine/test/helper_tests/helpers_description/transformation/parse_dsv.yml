    This parser can be used to extract values separated by a specific delimiter (“delimiter separated values”)
    which must be a single character. These values will be stored on user-specified fields (outputs)
    but only if all the expected outputs are obtained. Eg, user expects 4 values but only 3 can be obtained
    then the parser fails and no value is stored.
    Additionally to the “delimiting” character, the user must define a “quoting” and “escaping” character.
    All the characters contained between the “quoting” characters will be considered part
    of  a single value, even the “delimiting” character. If the quoting is not correctly balanced, the parser will fail.
    The “escaping” character is used to escape the “quoting” characters that are intended to be used as literal characters.
    This helper function is typically used in the map stage.
