    This parser is just the same as the “dsv” parser, but its delimiter is the “comma”, the quoting and escaping character
    are the quotation mark, and they cannot be changed.
    It can be used to extract values separated by commas (“comma separated values”).
    These values will be stored on user-specified fields (outputs), but only if all the expected outputs are obtained.
    Eg, user expects 4 values but only 3 can be obtained, then the parser fails and no value is stored.
    All the characters contained between the “quoting” characters will be considered part of a single value
    even the “comma” character. If the quoting is not correctly balanced, the parser will fail.
    The “escaping” character is used to escape the “quoting” characters that are intended to be used as literal characters.
    This helper function is typically used in the map stage.
