# Name of the helper function
name: discard_events

metadata:
  description: |
    Immediately stops event processing in the pipeline by setting the discard flag. This helper is used to prevent events from being enriched and/or indexed based on specific conditions.

    Behavior depends on policy configuration (index_discarded_events):
    - If false: All event fields are preserved, only the discard flag is set to true. Works as a dry-run mode where events are marked as discarded but still available for enrichment and indexing.
    - If true: All event fields are erased (only the discard flag remains). This is a more aggressive discard mode that ensures no data from the event is retained or indexed.

    Usage Rules:
    - Must be used with the exact target field 'wazuh.space.event_discarded'
    - Cannot accept any parameters
    - Should be called in the normalization/map stage when a discard condition is met
