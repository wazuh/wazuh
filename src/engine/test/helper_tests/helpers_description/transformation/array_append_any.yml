# Name of the helper function
name: array_append_any

metadata:
  description: |
    Adds the values or references of any Json type to the target array field.
    This helper function is normally used in the map stage.
    If the target field exists and is not an array it will be overridden, if it does not exist it will be created.
    This operation will not fail if a reference parameter is not found, any parameters before or after
    it will be added to the target field.
    As it is an array, only elements of the same type can be added. The type of the first element contained in the array
    will always be taken or, failing that, the type of the first element to be added.
