# Name of the helper function

  description: |
    Merge “any_object“ into “field”. Both fields must be the same type and of type object or type array
    otherwise the operation will fail and neither fields will be modified.
    The result of the merge operation is mapped to “field” and “any_object“ is deleted.
    When merging objects, if a collision is produced the target key will be overridden by the reference key.
    When merging arrays, if a collision is produced the target key will be preserved in its original order
    and will be not duplicated.
    This helper function is typically used in the map stage
