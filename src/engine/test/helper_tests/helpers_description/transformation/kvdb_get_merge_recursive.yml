# Name of the helper function
name: kvdb_get_merge_recursive

metadata:
  description: |
    Gets the value of a given key in the DB named db-name and, if successful, merges this value with what the field had before.
    The merge process is recursive, meaning that for object or array types, the new value is deeply integrated with the existing value in the field.
    Key value type can be string, number, object, array, or null, and it must match the previous value type held by the field.
    This helper function is typically used in the map stage.
