  description: |
    The operation splits a string into parts by a separator character.
    The parts are put into an array of strings. The result of the split into array (split) operation is mapped to “field”.
    If the “field” already exists, then it will be replaced. In case of errors “field” will not be modified.
    This helper function is typically used in the map stage
