# Name of the helper function
name: has_keys

  description: |
    Checks if all the specified keys from the target field (an object) are present in the given list.
    It verifies whether the elements in the list are included as keys in the target object.
    If any key from the target object is missing in the list, the validation fails.
    The function does not require that all keys in the list be present in the target field,
    but all keys from the target field must be in the list.
    If any element in the list is not a string, or if the target object is missing any keys from the list, the validation fails.
    This helper is particularly useful for ensuring that all required keys are present in the object and
    are strictly enforced in the list.
