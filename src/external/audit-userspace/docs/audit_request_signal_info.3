.SH "DESCRIPTION"

audit_request_signal_info requests that the kernel send information about the sender of a signal to the audit daemon. The sinal info structure is as follows:

.nf
struct audit_sig_info {
        uid_t           uid;
        pid_t           pid;
        char            ctx[0];
};
.fi

This function is likely to be used only by audit daemons and shouldn't be called by any other kind of program.
