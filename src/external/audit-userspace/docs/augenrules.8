.SH SYNOPSIS

.RI [ \-\-check ]\ [ \-\-load ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBaugenrules\fP is a script that merges all component audit rules files,
found in the audit rules directory, \fI/etc/audit/rules.d\fP, placing the
merged file in \fI/etc/audit/audit.rules\fP. Component audit rule files, must
end in \fI.rules\fP in order to be processed. All other files in
\fI/etc/audit/rules.d\fP are ignored.
.P
The files are concatenated in order, based on their natural sort (see -v option of ls(1)) and stripped of empty and comment (#) lines.
.P
The last processed -\fID\fP directive without an option, if present, is always
emitted as the first line in the resultant file. Those with an option are
replicated in place.
The last processed -\fIb\fP directive, if present, is always
emitted as the second line in the resultant file.
The last processed -\fIf\fP directive, if present, is always
emitted as the third line in the resultant file.
The last processed -\fIe\fP directive, if present, is always
emitted as the last line in the resultant file.
.P
The generated file is only copied to \fI/etc/audit/audit.rules\fP, if it differs.
