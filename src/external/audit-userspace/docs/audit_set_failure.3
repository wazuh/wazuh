.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.B #include <libaudit.h>
.sp
int audit_set_failure(int fd, int failure);

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

audit_set_failure sets the action that the kernel will perform when the backlog limit is reached or when it encounters an error and cannot proceed. Possible values are:

.TP
0 - AUDIT_FAIL_SILENT
Do nothing, report nothing, skip logging the record and continue.

.TP
1 - AUDIT_FAIL_PRINTK [default]
Log the audit record using printk which will cause subsequent events to get written to syslog.

.TP
2 - AUDIT_FAIL_PANIC
Call the panic function. This would be used to prevent use of the machine upon loss of audit events.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"

The return value is <= 0 on error, otherwise it is the netlink sequence id number. This function can have any error that sendto would encounter.
