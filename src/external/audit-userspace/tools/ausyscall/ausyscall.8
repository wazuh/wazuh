.TH AUSYSCALL: "8" "Nov 2008" "Red Hat" "System Administration Utilities"
.SH NAME
ausyscall \- a program that allows mapping syscall names and numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ausyscall [arch] name | number | \-\-dump | \-\-exact
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBausyscall\fP is a program that prints out the mapping from syscall name to number and reverse for the given arch. The arch can be anything returned by `uname \-m`. If arch is not given, the program will take a guess based on the running image. You may give the syscall name or number and it will find the opposite. You can also dump the whole table with the \-\-dump option. By default a syscall name lookup will be a substring match meaning that it will try to match all occurrences of the given name with syscalls. So giving a name of chown will match both fchown and chown as any other syscall with chown in its name. If this behavior is not desired, pass the \-\-exact flag and it will do an exact string match.

This program can be used to verify syscall numbers on a biarch platform for rule optimization. For example, suppose you had an auditctl rule:

.B \-a always, exit \-S open \-F exit=\-EPERM \-k fail\-open

If you wanted to verify that both 32 and 64 bit programs would be audited, run "ausyscall i386 open" and then "ausyscall x86_64 open". Look at the returned numbers. If they are different, you will have to write two auditctl rules to get complete coverage.

.nf
.B \-a always,exit \-F arch=b32 \-S open \-F exit=\-EPERM \-k fail\-open
.B \-a always,exit \-F arch=b64 \-S open \-F exit=\-EPERM \-k fail\-open
.fi

For more information about a specific syscall, use the man program and pass the number 2 as an argument to make sure that you get the syscall information rather than a shell script program or glibc function call of the same name. For example, if you wanted to learn about the open syscall, type: man 2 open.
