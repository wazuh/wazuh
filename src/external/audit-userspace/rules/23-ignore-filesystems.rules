# This rule supresses events that originate on the below file systems.
# Typically you would use this in conjunction with rules to monitor
# kernel modules. The filesystem listed are known to cause hundreds of
# path records during kernel module load. As an aside, if you do see the
# tracefs or debugfs module load and this is a production system, you really
# should look into why its getting loaded and prevent it if possible.
