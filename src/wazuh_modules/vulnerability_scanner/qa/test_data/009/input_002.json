    "description": "SSH (Secure SHell) is a program for logging into and executing\ncommands on a remote machine. SSH is intended to replace rlogin and\nrsh, and to provide secure encrypted communications between two\nuntrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and\narbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.\n\nOpenSSH is OpenBSD's version of the last free version of SSH, bringing\nit up to date in terms of security and features.\n\nThis package includes the core files necessary for both the OpenSSH\nclient and server. To make this package useful, you should also\ninstall openssh-clients, openssh-server, or both.",
