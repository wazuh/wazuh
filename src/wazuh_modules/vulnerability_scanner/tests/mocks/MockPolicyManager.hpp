 * @class MockPolicyManager
 *
 * @brief Mock class for simulating a policy manager object.
 *
 * The `MockPolicyManager` class is designed to simulate the behavior of a content
 * register for testing purposes. It provides mock implementations of methods and
 * allows you to set expectations on method calls and their return values for testing.
 *
 * This class is used in unit tests only to verify interactions with a content
 * register without actually performing real operations on it.
