# The option Port specifies on which port number ssh daemon listens for incoming connections.
# Changing the default port you may reduce the number of successful attacks from zombie bots, an attacker or bot doing port-scanning can quickly identify your SSH port.

# The option PermitRootLogin specifies whether root can log in using ssh.
