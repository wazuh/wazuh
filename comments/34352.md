## Additional WinDbg findings

WinDbg analysis with debug symbols places the crash in the `buffer_append()` function at:

```c
buffer[i] = strdup(msg);
```

At the time of the crash, the following variable values were observed:

```
buffer = 0x130271d8
i = 0
j = 0
msg = 0x223a2265: "???"
status = 1
```

This symptom looks similar to https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/issues/34103 (which we considered resolved), although we still do not have a rigorous explanation for the root cause.
