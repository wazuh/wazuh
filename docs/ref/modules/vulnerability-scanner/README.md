# Introduction

The Vulnerability Scanner (VD) is an event-driven module that detects CVEs using the inventory batches produced by InventorySync. On the agent, Syscollector gathers OS, package, and hotfix data and InventorySync ships it to the manager as Start/DataValue/DataContext sessions. VD consumes those sessions, correlates them with the local CVE databases, and generates results.

The CVE data comes from [CTI](https://cti.wazuh.com/vulnerabilities/cves), which is parsed into local RocksDB databases for fast lookups. Detection produces:

- ECS-formatted documents indexed into `wazuh-states-vulnerabilities` via the Indexer Connector.
- Engine alert events sent to `queue-http.sock` using the H/E protocol.

OS detection is supported for Windows and macOS (Darwin). On Linux, the kernel is treated as a package component.
