  - You have these installation options: manager, agent, local, or hybrid.

    - If you choose 'manager', you will be able to analyze all
      the logs, create e-mail notifications and responses,
      and also receive logs from remote syslog machines and
      from systems running the 'agents' (from where traffic
      is sent encrypted to the manager).

    - If you choose 'agent'(client), you will be able to read
      local files (from syslog, snort, apache, etc) and forward
      them (encrypted) to the manager for analysis.

    - If you choose 'local', you will be able to do everything
      the manager does, except receiving remote messages from
      the agents or external syslog devices.

    - If you choose 'hybrid', you get the 'local' installation
      plus the 'agent' installation.

  - Choose 'manager' if you are setting up a log/analysis manager.

  - Choose 'agent' if you have another machine to run as a log
    manager and want to forward the logs to the manager for analysis.
    (ideal for webservers, database managers ,etc)

  - Choose 'local' if you only have one system to monitor.

  - Choose 'hybrid' if you want this standalone system to analyze
    local logs before forwarding alerts to another manager.
