     - Active response enabled.

   - By default, we can enable the host-deny and the
     firewall-drop responses. The first one will add
     a host to the /etc/hosts.deny and the second one
     will block the host on iptables (if linux) or on
     ipfilter (if FreeBSD or NetBSD).
   - They can be used to stop SSHD brute force scans,
     portscans and some other forms of attacks. You can
     also add them to block on snort events, for example.
