#2.3 Disable WebDAV Modules
checks:
 - id: 3500
   title: "Ensure the WebDAV Modules Are Disabled"
   description: "The Apache mod_dav and mod_dav_fs modules support WebDAV functionality for Apache, which is an extension to the HTTP protocol which allows clients to create, move, and delete files and resources on the web server."
   rationale: "Disabling WebDAV modules will improve the security posture of the web server by reducing the amount of potentially vulnerable code paths exposed to the network and reducing potential for unauthorized access to files via misconfigured WebDAV access controls."
   remediation: "For source builds with static modules run the Apache ./configure script without including the mod_dav , and mod_dav_fs in the --enable-modules=configure script options. For dynamically loaded modules comment out the LoadModule directive for mod_dav, and mod_dav_fs modules from the httpd.conf file."

   title: "Ensure the Status Module Is Disabled"
   description: "The Apache mod_status module provides current server performance statistics."
   rationale: "While having server performance status information available as a web page may be convenient, it's recommended that this module be disabled. When it is enabled, its handler capability is available in all configuration files, including per-directory files."

#2.5 Disable Autoindex Module
 - id: 3502
   title: "Ensure the Autoindex Module Is Disabled"
   description: "The Apache mod_autoindex module automatically generates a web page listing the contents of directories on the server, typically used so an index.html does not have to be generated."
   rationale: "Automated directory listings should not be enabled because they will reveal information helpful to an attacker such as naming conventions and directory paths. They may also reveal files that were not intended to be revealed."
   remediation: "For source builds with static modules, run the Apache ./configure script with the - -disable-autoindex configure script options. For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the LoadModule directive for the mod_autoindex module from the httpd.conf file."

#2.6 Disable Proxy Modules
 - id: 3503
   title: "Ensure the Proxy Modules Are Disabled"
   description: "The Apache proxy modules allow the server to act as a proxy for HTTP and other protocols with additional proxy modules loaded. If the Apache installation is not intended to proxy requests to or from another network, the proxy module should not be loaded."
   rationale: "A web server should be primarily a web server or a proxy server but not both, for the same reasons that other multi-use servers are not recommended."
   remediation: "For source builds with static modules, run the Apache ./configure script without including the mod_proxy and all other proxy modules in the --enable- modules=configure script options. For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the LoadModule directive for the mod_proxy module and all other proxy modules from the httpd.conf file."

#2.7 Disable User Directories Modules
 - id: 3504
   title: "Ensure the User Directories Module Is Disabled"
   description: "The UserDir directive must be disabled so that user home directories are not accessed via the web site with a tilde (~) preceding the username. The directive also sets the path name of the directory that will be accessed."
   rationale: "The user directories should not be globally enabled since that allows anonymous access to anything users may want to share with other users on the network."
   remediation: "For source builds with static modules, run the Apache ./configure script with the --disable-userdir configure script option. For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the LoadModule directive for the mod_userdir module from the httpd.conf file."
   compliance:
    - cis: "2.7"

#2.8 Disable Info Module
 - id: 3505
   title: "Ensure the Info Module Is Disabled"
   description: "The Apache mod_info module provides information on the server configuration via access to a /server-info URL location."
   rationale: "Although having server configuration information available as a web page may be convenient, it's recommended that this module be disabled. Once the module is loaded into the server, its handler capability is available in per-directory .htaccess files. This can leak sensitive information from the configuration directives of other Apache modules."
   remediation: "For source builds with static modules, run the Apache ./configure script without including mod_info in the --enable-modules= configure script options. For dynamically loaded modules, comment out or remove the LoadModule directive for the mod_info module from the httpd.conf file."

#3.2 Give the Apache User Account an Invalid Shell
 - id: 3506
   title: "Ensure the Apache User Account Has an Invalid Shell"
   description: "The apache account must not be used as a regular login account, so it should be assigned an invalid or nologin shell to ensure it cannot be used to log in."
   rationale: "Service accounts such as the apache account are a risk if they can be used to get a login shell to the system."
   remediation: "Change the apache account to use the nologin shell or an invalid shell such as /dev/null: # chsh -s /sbin/nologin apache"
   compliance:
    - cis: "3.2"

#3.3 Lock the Apache User Account
 - id: 3507
   title: "Ensure the Apache User Account Is Locked"
   description: "The user account under which Apache runs should not have a valid password, but should be locked."
   rationale: "As a defense-in-depth measure, the Apache user account should be locked to prevent logins and to prevent a user from su-ing to apache using the password."
   remediation: "Use the passwd command to lock the apache account: # passwd -l apache"
   compliance:
    - cis: "3.3"

#4.4 Restrict Override for All Directories
 - id: 3508
   title: "Ensure OverRide Is Disabled for All Directories"
   description: "When the server finds an .htaccess file (as specified by AccessFileName), it needs to know which directives declared in that file can override earlier access information. When this directive is set to None, .htaccess files are completely ignored. When this directive is set to All, any directive which has the .htaccess Context is allowed in .htaccess files."
   rationale: "While the functionality of htaccess files is sometimes convenient, usage decentralizes the access controls and increases the risk of configurations being changed or viewed inappropriately by an unintended or rogue .htaccess file. Consider also that some of the more common vulnerabilities in web servers and web applications allow the web files to be viewed or to be modified."
   remediation: "Search the Apache configuration files ( httpd.conf and any included configuration files) to find AllowOverride directives. Set the value for all AllowOverride directives to None."
   compliance:

#5.3 Minimize Options for Other Directories
 - id: 3509
   title: "Ensure Options for Other Directories Are Minimized"
   description: "The Apache Options directive allows for specific configuration of options, including execution of CGI, following symbolic links, server side includes, and content negotiation."
   rationale: "The options for other directories and hosts should be restricted to the minimal options required. A setting of None is recommended; however, other options may be needed in some cases: Multiviews, FollowSymbolicLinks & SymLinksIfOwnerMatch, ExecCGI, Includes & IncludesNOEXEC, Indexes."
   remediation: "Search the Apache configuration files (httpd.conf and any included configuration files) to find all <Directory> elements. Add or modify any existing Options directive to NOT have a value of Includes. Other options may be set if necessary and appropriate as described above."

#5.4.1 Remove default index.html sites
 - id: 3510
   title: "Ensure Default HTML Content Is Removed (index.html)"
   description: "Apache installations have default content that is not needed or appropriate for production use. The primary function for the sample content is to provide a default web site, provide user manuals, or demonstrate special features of the web server. All content that is not needed should be removed."
   rationale: "Historically, sample content and features have been remotely exploited and can provide different levels of access to the server. Usually these routines are not written for production use and consequently little thought was given to security in their development."
   remediation: "Review all pre-installed content and remove content which is not required. In particular, look for unnecessary content in the document root directory, in a configuration directory such as conf/extra directory, or as a Unix/Linux package."

#5.5 Remove default CGI content printenv
 - id: 3513
   title: "Ensure the Default CGI Content printenv Script Is Removed"
   description: "Most web servers, including Apache installations, have default CGI content which is not needed or appropriate for production use. The primary function for these sample programs is to demonstrate the capabilities of the web server. One common default CGI content for apache installations is the script printenv that will print back to the requester all of the CGI environment variables, which include many server configuration details and system paths."
   rationale: "Since CGI programs are often targets of attackers, we need to make sure there are no unnecessary CGI programs that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. The printenv script in particular will disclose inappropriate information about the web server, including directory paths and detailed version and configuration information."
   remediation: "Locate cgi-bin files and directories enabled in the Apache configuration via the Script , ScriptAlias , ScriptAliasMatch , or ScriptInterpreterSource directives. Remove the printenv default CGI in the cgi-bin directory if it is installed."

A common default CGI content for Apache installations is the script test-cgi that will print back to the requester CGI environment variables, which includes many server configuration details."
   rationale: "Since CGI programs are often targets of attackers, we need to make sure there are no unnecessary CGI programs that could potentially be used for malicious purposes. The test-cgi script in particular will disclose inappropriate information about the web server, including directory paths and detailed version and configuration information."

#5.7 Limit HTTP Request Method
 - id: 3515
   title: "Ensure HTTP Request Methods Are Restricted"
   description: "Use the Apache <LimitExcept> directive to restrict unnecessary HTTP request methods of the web server so it only accepts and processes the GET, HEAD, POST and OPTIONS HTTP request methods."
   rationale: "The HTTP 1.1 protocol supports several request methods which are rarely used and potentially high risk. For normal web server operation, you will typically need to allow only the GET, HEAD and POST request methods."
   remediation: "Search for the directive on the document root directory, ensure that the access control order within the <Directory> directive is deny, allow. Add a directive within the group of document root directives and search in other Apache configuration files in places other than de root directory."

#5.8 Disable HTTP Trace Method
 - id: 3516
   title: "Ensure the HTTP TRACE Method Is Disabled"
   description: "Use the Apache TraceEnable directive to disable the HTTP TRACE request method."
   rationale: "The HTTP 1.1 protocol requires support for the TRACE request method, which reflects the request back as a response and was intended for diagnostics purposes. The TRACE method is not needed and is easily subjected to abuse, so it should be disabled."
   remediation: "Locate the main Apache configuration file such as httpd.conf. Add a TraceEnable directive to the server level configuration with a value of off. Server level configuration is the top level configuration, not nested within any other directives like <Directory> or <Location>."

#5.9 Restrict HTTP Protocol Versions
 - id: 3517
   title: "Ensure Old HTTP Versions Are Disallowed"
   description: "The Apache modules mod_rewrite and mod_security can be used to disallow old and invalid HTTP versions. The HTTP version 1.1 RFC is dated June 1999 and has been supported by Apache since version 1.2, so it should no longer be necessary to allow ancient versions of HTTP prior to 1.1."
   rationale: "Many malicious automated programs, vulnerability scanners, and fingerprinting tools send requests using old HTTP versions to see how the web server responds. These requests are usually part of the attacker's enumeration process."
   remediation: "Load the mod_rewrite module, add the RewriteEngine directive to the configuration within the global server context with the value of on so the rewrite engine is enabled. Locate the main Apache configuration file such as httpd.conf and add a condition to match HTTP/1.1 and the rewrite rule to the top server level configuration to disallow other protocol versions."

#5.12 Deny IP Address Based Requests
 - id: 3518
   title: "Ensure IP Address Based Requests Are Disallowed"
   description: "The Apache module mod_rewrite should disallow access for requests that use an IP address instead of a host name for the URL. Most normal access to the website from browsers and automated software will use a hostname, and will therefore include the hostname in the HTTP HOST header."
   rationale: "A common malware propagation and automated network scanning technique is to use IP addresses rather than hostnames for web requests, since it's simpler to automate. By denying IP-based web requests, these automated techniques will be denied access to the website."
   remediation: "Load the mod_rewrite module for Apache. Add the RewriteEngine directive to the configuration within the global server context with the value of on. Locate the Apache configuration file such as httdp.conf and add a condition to match the expected host name of the top server level configuration."

#5.13 Restrict Listen Directive
 - id: 3519
   title: "Ensure the IP Addresses for Listening for Requests Are Specified"
   description: "The Apache Listen directive specifies the IP addresses and port numbers the Apache web server will listen on for requests. Rather than be unrestricted to listen on all IP addresses available to the system, the specific IP address or addresses intended should be explicitly specified. Specifically, a Listen directive with no IP address specified or with an IP address of all zeroes should not be used."
   rationale: "Having multiple interfaces on web servers is fairly common, and without explicit Listen directives, the web server is likely to be listening on an IP address or interface that was not intended for the web server."
   remediation: "Find any Listen directives in the Apache configuration file with no IP address specified or with an IP address of all zeroes similar to the examples below. Keep in mind there may be both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on the system. Modify the Listen directives in the Apache configuration file to have explicit IP addresses according to the intended usage.

#5.14 Restrict Browser Frame Options

   title: "Ensure Browser Framing Is Restricted"
   description: "The Header directive allows server HTTP response headers to be added, replaced, or merged. Use the directive to add a server HTTP response header to tell browsers to restrict all the web pages from being framed by other web sites."
   rationale: "Using iframes and regular web frames to embed malicious content along with expected web content has been a favored attack vector for attacking web clients for a long time. This can happen when the attacker lures the victim to a malicious web site, which uses frames to include the expected content from the legitimate site."
   remediation: "Perform the following to implement the recommended state: Add or modify the Header directive for the X-Frame-Options header in the Apache configuration to have the condition always , an action of append , and a value of SAMEORIGIN , as shown: Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN"

   title: "Ensure the Error Log Filename and Severity Level Are Configured Correctly"
   description: "The LogLevel directive is used to configure the severity level for the error logs, while the ErrorLog directive configures the error log filename. The log level values are the standard syslog levels of emerg , alert , crit , error , warn , notice , info and debug . The recommended level is notice , so that all errors from the emerg level through the notice level will be logged."
   rationale: "The server error logs are invaluable because they can be used to spot potential problems before they become serious. Most importantly, they can be used to watch for anomalous behavior such as numerous 'not found' or 'unauthorized' errors that may be an indication an attack is pending or has occurred."
   remediation: "Add or modify the LogLevel in the Apache configuration to have a value of info or lower for the core module and notice or lower for all other modules.

   title: "Enable OCSP Stapling"
   description: "The OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) provides the current revocation status of an X.509 certificate and allows for a certificate authority to revoke the validity of a signed certificate before its expiration date."
   rationale: "The OCSP protocol is a big improvement over CRLs (certificate revocation lists) for checking if a certificate has been revoked. The OCSP stapling improves the situation by having the SSL server 'staple' an OCSP response, signed by the OCSP server, to the certificate it presents to the client. This obviates the need for the client to ask the OCSP server for status information on the server certificate."

#9.6 Set Timeout Limits for Request Body
 - id: 3536
   title: "Ensure Timeout Limits for the Request Body Are Set Properly"
   description: "The RequestReadTimeout directive allows setting timeout values for the body portion of a request. The directive provides for an initial timeout value, a maximum timeout, and a minimum rate."
   rationale: "It is not sufficient to timeout only on the header portion of the request, as the server will still be vulnerable to attacks."
   remediation: "Load the mod_requesttimeout module in the Apache configuration and add a RequestReadTimeout directive similar to the one below with the maximum request body timeout value of 20 seconds or less."
