    title: "Ensure 'Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "For a computer to print to a shared printer, the driver for that shared printer must be installed on the local computer. This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators."
    rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Devices: Prevent users from installing printer drivers."

    title: "Ensure 'Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)' is set to '4 or fewer logon(s)'"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether a user can log on to a Windows domain using cached account information. Logon information for domain accounts can be cached locally to allow users to log on even if a Domain Controller cannot be contacted. This policy setting determines the number of unique users for whom logon information is cached locally. If this value is set to 0, the logon cache feature is disabled. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the server could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to determine user passwords. The recommended state for this setting is: 4 or fewer logon(s)."
    rationale: "The number that is assigned to this policy setting indicates the number of users whose logon information the computer will cache locally. If the number is set to 4, then the computer caches logon information for 4 users. When a 5th user logs on to the computer, the server overwrites the oldest cached logon session. Users who access the computer console will have their logon credentials cached on that computer. An attacker who is able to access the file system of the computer could locate this cached information and use a brute force attack to attempt to determine user passwords. To mitigate this type of attack, Windows encrypts the information and obscures its physical location."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 4 or fewer logon(s): Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)"

    description: "This policy setting determines whether users' private keys (such as their S-MIME keys) require a password to be used. The recommended state for this setting is: User is prompted when the key is first used. Configuring this setting to User must enter a password each time they use a key also conforms to the benchmark."
    rationale: "If a user's account is compromised or their computer is inadvertently left unsecured the malicious user can use the keys stored for the user to access protected resources. You can configure this policy setting so that users must provide a password that is distinct from their domain password every time they use a key. This configuration makes it more difficult for an attacker to access locally stored user keys, even if the attacker takes control of the user's computer and determines their logon password."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to User is prompted when the key is first used (configuring to User must enter a password each time they use a key also conforms to the benchmark): Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\System cryptography: Force strong key protection for user keys stored on the computer."

    title: "Ensure 'Bluetooth Support Service (bthserv)' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "The Bluetooth service supports discovery and association of remote Bluetooth devices. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "Bluetooth technology has inherent security risks - especially prior to the v2.1 standard. Wireless Bluetooth traffic is not well encrypted (if at all), so in a high-security environment, it should not be permitted, in spite of the added inconvenience of not being able to use Bluetooth devices."

    description: "Windows service for application access to downloaded maps. This service is started on- demand by application accessing downloaded maps."
    rationale: "Mapping technologies can unwillingly reveal your location to attackers and other software that picks up the information. In addition, automatic downloads of data from 3rd-party sources should be minimized when not needed. Therefore this service should not be needed in high security environments."

    description: "This service monitors the current location of the system and manages geofences (a geographical location with associated events). The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "This setting affects the location feature (e.g. GPS or other location tracking). From a security perspective, it's not a good idea to reveal your location to software in most cases, but there are legitimate uses, such as mapping software. However, they should not be used in high security environments."

    description: "Manages Internet SCSI (iSCSI) sessions from this computer to remote target devices. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "This service is critically necessary in order to directly attach to an iSCSI device. However, iSCSI itself uses a very weak authentication protocol (CHAP), which means that the passwords for iSCSI communication are easily exposed, unless all of the traffic is isolated and/or encrypted using another technology like IPsec. This service is generally more appropriate for servers in a controlled environment then on workstations requiring high security."

    title: "Ensure 'MSS: (DisableSavePassword) Prevent the dial-up password from being saved' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "When you dial a phonebook or VPN entry in Dial-Up Networking, you can use the \"Save Password\" option so that your Dial-Up Networking password is cached and you will not need to enter it on successive dial attempts. For security, administrators may want to prevent users from caching passwords. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "An attacker who steals a mobile user's computer could automatically connect to the organization's network if the Save This Password check box is selected for the dial-up or VPN networking entry used to connect to your organization's network."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\MSS (Legacy)\\MSS:(DisableSavePassword) Prevent the dial-up password from being saved. Note: This Group Policy path does not exist by default.

    description: "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)"
    rationale: "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components reduces a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD): HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:Disabl edComponents Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide an ADMX template to configure this registry value, a custom .ADM template (Disable-IPv6-Components-KB929852.adm) is provided in the CIS Benchmark Remediation Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off the group policy setting in the .ADM template will not \"undo\" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state."
