    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var"
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp"
    description: "The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log"
    description: "The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data."
    rationale: "There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and protection of audit data."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit"
    description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
    rationale: "There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog) consume space in the same partition as auditd, it may not perform as desired."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    rationale: "If the system is intended to support local users, create a separate partition for the /home directory to protect against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be stored under /home."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    title: "Ensure CUPS is not enabled"
    description: "The Common Unix Print System (CUPS) provides the ability to print to both local and network printers. A system running CUPS can also accept print jobs from remote systems and print them to local printers. It also provides a web based remote administration capability."
    rationale: "If the system does not need to print jobs or accept print jobs from other systems, it is recommended that CUPS be disabled to reduce the potential attack surface."

# 4 Logging and Auditing

  - id: 3508
    title: "Ensure audit log storage size is configured"
    description: "Configure the maximum size of the audit log file. Once the log reaches the maximum size, it will be rotated and a new log file will be started."
    rationale: "It is important that an appropriate size is determined for log files so that they do not impact the system and audit data is not lost."
    remediation: "Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf in accordance with site policy: max_log_file = <MB> Notes: The max_log_file parameter is measured in megabytes."

  - id: 3509
    title: "Ensure system is disabled when audit logs are full"
    description: "The auditd daemon can be configured to halt the system when the audit logs are full."
    rationale: "In high security contexts, the risk of detecting unauthorized access or nonrepudiation exceeds the benefit of the system's availability."
    remediation: "Set the following parameters in /etc/audit/auditd.conf: space_left_action = email action_mail_acct = root admin_space_left_action = halt"

    title: "Ensure audit logs are not automatically deleted"
    description: "The max_log_file_action setting determines how to handle the audit log file reaching the max file size. A value of keep_logs will rotate the logs but never delete old logs."
    rationale: "In high security contexts, the benefits of maintaining a long audit history exceed the cost of storing the audit history."
    remediation: "Set the following parameter in /etc/audit/auditd.conf: max_log_file_action = keep_logs"

    description: "Turn on the auditd daemon to record system events."
    rationale: "The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to allow them to determine if unauthorized access to their system is occurring."

    rationale: "Audit events need to be captured on processes that start up prior to auditd, so that potential malicious activity cannot go undetected."
    remediation: "Edit /etc/default/grub and add audit=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=\"audit=1\" Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration: # update-grub Notes: This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings."

    rationale: "Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the system."

The other parameters monitor the /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net files (messages displayed pre- login), /etc/hosts (file containing host names and associated IP addresses) and /etc/sysconfig/network (directory containing network interface scripts and configurations) files."
    rationale: "Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored for changes in the file that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the machine becoming unavailable or compromised.

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user."
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."
