# 2 Filesystem Configuration
 - id: 10500
   title: "Create Separate Partition for /tmp"
   description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
   rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
   remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /tmp.  For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

   title: " Create Separate Partition for /var"
   description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
   rationale: "Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition."
   remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var.  For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

   title: "Bind Mount the /var/tmp directory to /tmp"
   description: "The /var/tmp directory is normally a standalone directory in the /var file system. Binding /var/tmp to /tmp establishes an unbreakable link to /tmp that cannot be removed (even by the root user). It also allows /var/tmp to inherit the same mount options that /tmp owns, allowing /var/tmp to be protected in the same manner /tmp is protected. It will also prevent /var from filling up with temporary files as the contents of /var/tmp will actually reside in the file system containing /tmp."
   rationale: "All programs that use /var/tmp and /tmp to read/write temporary files will always be written to the /tmp file system, preventing a user from running the /var file system out of space or trying to perform operations that have been blocked in the /tmp filesystem."
   remediation: "# mount --bind /tmp /var/tmp  and edit the /etc/fstab file to contain the following line: /tmp /var/tmp none bind 0 0"

   description: "The /var/log directory is used by system services to store log data."
   rationale: "There are two important reasons to ensure that system logs are stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since logs can grow quite large) and protection of audit data."
   remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log.  For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

   title: "Create Separate Partition for /var/log/audit"
   description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
   rationale: "There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog) consume space in the same partition as auditd, it may not perform as desired."
   remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit.  For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

   title: "Create Separate Partition for /home"
   description: "The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users."
   rationale: "If the system is intended to support local users, create a separate partition for the /home directory to protect against resource exhaustion and restrict the type of files that can be stored under /home."
   remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home.  For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

   title: "Add nodev Option to /home"
   description: "When set on a file system, this option prevents character and block special devices from being defined, or if they exist, from being used as character and block special devices."
   rationale: "Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.  Note: The actions in the item refer to the /home partition, which is the default user partition that is defined in many distributions. If you have created other user partitions, it is recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as well."

   description: "Set nodev on removable media to prevent character and block special devices that are present on the removable media from being treated as device files."
   rationale: "Removable media containing character and block special devices could be used to circumvent security controls by allowing non-root users to access sensitive device files such as /dev/kmem or the raw disk partitions."
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/fstab file and add \"nodev\" to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information."

   title: "Add noexec Option to Removable Media Partitions"
   description: "Set noexec on removable media to prevent programs from executing from the removable media."
   rationale: "Setting this option on a file system prevents users from executing programs from the removable media. This deters users from being able to introduce potentially malicious software on the system."
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/fstab file and add noexec to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information."

   description: "Set nosuid on removable media to prevent setuid and setgid executable files that are on that media from being executed as setuid and setgid."
   rationale: "Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them."
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for entries that have mount points that contain words such as floppy or cdrom. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information."

   title: "Add nodev Option to /run/shm Partition"
   description: "The nodev mount option specifies that the /run/shm (temporary filesystem stored in memory) cannot contain block or character special devices."
   rationale: "Since the /run/shm filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create special devices in /run/shm partitions."
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nodev to the fourth field (mounting options of entries that have mount points that contain /run/shm. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.  # mount -o remount,nodev /run/shm"

   title: "Add nosuid Option to /run/shm Partition"
   description: "The nosuid mount option specifies that the /run/shm (temporary filesystem stored in memory) will not execute setuid and setgid on executable programs as such, but rather execute them with the uid and gid of the user executing the program."
   rationale: "Setting this option on a file system prevents users from introducing privileged programs onto the system and allowing non-root users to execute them."
   remediation: "Edit the /etc/fstab file and add nosuid to the fourth field (mounting options). Look for entries that have mount points that contain /run/shm. See the fstab(5) manual page for more information.  # mount -o remount,nosuid /run/shm"

# 3 Secure Boot Settings
 - id: 10517
   title: "Set Boot Loader Password"
   description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters"
   rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
   remediation: "Create an encrypted password with grub-md5-crypt: # grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 Enter password: <password> Reenter password: <password> Your PBKDF2 is <encrypted-password>  Add the following into /etc/grub.d/00_header or a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file: cat <<EOF set superusers=\"<user-list>\" password_pbkdf2 <user> <encrypted-password> EOF Unless the --unrestricted option is added to CLASS in /etc/grub.d/10_linux a password will be required to boot in addition to editing boot parameters: CLASS=\"--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted\" Run the following to update the grub configuration: # update-grub"

   title: "Require Authentication for Single-User Mode"
   description: "Setting a password for the root user will force authentication in single user mode."
   rationale: "Requiring authentication in single user mode prevents an unauthorized user from rebooting the system into single user to gain root privileges without credentials."

# 4 Additional Process Hardening
 - id: 10519
   title: "Restrict Core Dumps"
   description: "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user."
   rationale: "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5)). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."
   remediation: "Add the following line to the /etc/security/limits.conf file.  * hard core 0     Add the following line to the /etc/sysctl.conf file.  fs.suid_dumpable = 0"

   title: "Ensure NIS is not installed"
   description: "The Network Information Service (NIS), formerly known as Yellow Pages, is a client-server directory service protocol used to distribute system configuration files."
   rationale: "The NIS service is inherently an insecure system that has been vulnerable to DOS attacks, buffer overflows and has poor authentication for querying NIS maps. NIS generally has been replaced by such protocols as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). It is recommended that the service be removed."

SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
   rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a server by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

   title: "Set Idle Timeout Interval for User Login"
   description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
   rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..  While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent."

Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su."
   rationale: "Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."

   rationale: "Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.
