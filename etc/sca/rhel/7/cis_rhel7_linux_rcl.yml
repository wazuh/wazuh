   title: "Ensure Reverse Path Filtering is enabled"
   description: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid."
   rationale: "Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your server bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed."
   remediation: "Set the net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter parameters to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf:net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1; net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1. Modify active kernel parameters to match: # /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter=1; # /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=1; # /sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1"

# 3.2.8 Enable TCP SYN Cookies (Scored)
 - id: 6559
   title: "Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled"
   description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent."
   rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack."
   remediation: "Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1 and set the active kernel parameters."
