# Listen PORT != 22
# The option Port specifies on which port number ssh daemon listens for incoming connections.
# Changing the default port you may reduce the number of successful attacks from zombie bots, an attacker or bot doing port-scanning can quickly identify your SSH port.

# Protocol 2
# The Protocol parameter dictates which version of the SSH communication and encryption protocols are in use.
# Version 1 of the SSH protocol has weaknesses. 
[SSH Hardening - 2: Protocol 1] [any] [2]
f:$sshd_file -> !r:^# && r:Protocol\.+1;


# PermitRootLogin no
# The option PermitRootLogin specifies whether root can log in using ssh.
# If you want log in as root, you should use the option "Match" and restrict it to a few IP addresses.

# PubkeyAuthentication yes
# Access only by public key
# Generally people will use weak passwords and have poor password practices. Keys are considered stronger than password.

# PasswordAuthentication no
# The option PasswordAuthentication specifies whether we should use password-based authentication.
# Use public key authentication instead of passwords

# PermitEmptyPasswords no
# The option PermitEmptyPasswords specifies whether the server allows logging in to accounts with a null password
# Accounts with null passwords are a bad practice.

# IgnoreRhosts yes
# The option IgnoreRhosts specifies whether rhosts or shosts files should not be used in authentication.
# For security reasons it is recommended to no use rhosts or shosts files for authentication.

# LoginGraceTime 30
# The option LoginGraceTime specifies how long in seconds after a connection request the server will wait before disconnecting if the user has not successfully logged in.
# 30 seconds is the recommended time for avoiding open connections without authenticate

# MaxAuthTries 3
# The MaxAuthTries parameter specifices the maximum number of authentication attempts permitted per connection. Once the number of failures reaches half this value, additional failures are logged.
# This should be set to 3.
