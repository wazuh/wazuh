  # 1.1 Filesystem configuration

  # 1.1.1.1 Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled. (Automated)

    title: "Ensure mounting of cramfs filesystems is disabled."
    description: "The cramfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A cramfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the server. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    remediation: "1) Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf and add the following line: install cramfs /bin/true. 2) Run the following command to unload the cramfs module: # rmmod cramfs."

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 18506
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid."

  - id: 18510
    title: "Ensure /dev/shm is configured."
    description: "/dev/shm is a traditional shared memory concept. One program will create a memory portion, which other processes (if permitted) can access. Mounting tmpfs at /dev/shm is handled automatically by systemd."
    rationale: "Making /dev/shm its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by mounting tmpfs to /dev/shm."
    impact: "Since the /dev/shm directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. /dev/shm utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "For specific configuration requirements of the /dev/shm mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /dev/shm defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0 tmpfs."

  - id: 18515
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp."
    description: "The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."

    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."

    title: "Ensure message of the day is configured properly."
    description: "The contents of the /etc/motd file are displayed to users after login and function as a message of the day for authenticated users. Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information: \\m - machine architecture \\r - operating system release \\s - operating system name \\v - operating system version."
    rationale: 'Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the " uname -a " command once they have logged in.'
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/motd file with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove any instances of \\m , \\r , \\s , \\v or references to the OS platform OR If the motd is not used, this file can be removed.

    title: "Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured."
    description: 'systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemd- timesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd. Note: The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd. This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.'
    rationale: "Proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is working properly. This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system."

  # 3.3.1 Ensure source routed packets are not accepted (Automated)
  - id: 18573
    title: "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted."
    description: "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."
    rationale: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."

  # 3.3.2 Ensure ICMP redirects are not accepted (Automated)

    title: "Ensure ICMP redirects are not accepted."
    description: "ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host (acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside routing device to update your system routing tables. By setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables."
    rationale: "Attackers could use bogus ICMP redirect messages to maliciously alter the system routing tables and get them to send packets to incorrect networks and allow your system packets to be captured."
    remediation: "Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects = 0 net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects = 0 Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters: # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_redirects=0 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_redirects=0 # sysctl -w net.ipv6.route.flush=1."

  # 3.3.8 Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled (Automated)
  - id: 18580
    title: "Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled."
    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the system to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack."
    remediation: "Set the following parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 1. Run the following commands to set the active kernel parameters: # sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=1 # sysctl -w net.ipv4.route.flush=1."

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

    description: "sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The invoking user's real (not effective) user ID is used to determine the user name with which to query the security policy."
    rationale: "sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. The default security policy is sudoers, which is configured via the file /etc/sudoers. The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism.

  # 5.3.5 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate (Automated)
  - id: 18650
    title: "Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate."
    description: "INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments."
    rationale: "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. DEBUG is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: LogLevel VERBOSE or LogLevel INFO."

    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy: ClientAliveInterval 300 ClientAliveCountMax 0."

  # 5.3.17 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less (Automated)
  - id: 18662
    title: "Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less."
    description: "The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access."
    rationale: "Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy."

    title: "Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured."
    description: "Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM. Set the lockout number to the policy in effect at your site."
    rationale: "Locking out user IDs after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts mitigates brute force password attacks against your systems."
    remediation: 'Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-auth file and add the auth line below: auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail audit silent deny=5 unlock_time=900. Edit the /etc/pam.d/common-account file and add the account lines below: account requisite pam_deny.so account required pam_tally2.so. Note: If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user. Notes:BUG In pam_tally2.so To work around this issue the addition of pam_tally2.so in the accounts section of the /etc/pam.d/common-account file has been added to the audit and remediation sections. pam_tally2 line must be added for the counter to reset to 0 when using sudo. Use of the "audit" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization.'

  - id: 18677
    title: "Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive."
    description: "The default umask determines the permissions of files created by users. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command into the standard shell configuration files ( .profile , .bashrc , etc.) in their home directories."
    rationale: "Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system."

  # 5.7 Ensure access to the su command is restricted (Automated)
  - id: 18679
    title: "Ensure access to the su command is restricted."
    description: "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the sudo group to execute su."
    rationale: "Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."
    remediation: "Create an empty group that will be specified for use of the su command. The group should be named according to site policy. Example # groupadd sugroup Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file, specifying the empty group: auth required pam_wheel.so use_uid group=sugroup."

This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack."
