    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: 'The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. - IF - an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as "Shmem" in /proc/meminfo and "Shared" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: - size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. - nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. - nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%. Internal Only - General.'
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Note: the size=2G is an example of setting a specific size for tmpfs. Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment: <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home and impact all local users. Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of /home options such as usrquota/grpquota may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. As /home contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var."
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follows. The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit."
    description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
    rationale: "The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log/audit directory contains the audit.log file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/log/audit and cause auditd to trigger it's space_left_action as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Configuring /var/log/audit as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. As /var/log/audit contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    description: "The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service. Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."

Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.'
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the snmpd package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: - The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values. -."
    impact: "There may be packages that are dependent on the snmpd package. If the snmpd package is removed, these packages will be removed as well. Before removing the snmpd package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system. If a dependent package is required, stop and mask the snmpd.service leaving the snmpd package installed. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to stop snmpd.service and remove the snmpd package: # systemctl stop snmpd.service # apt purge snmpd - OR - If the package is required for dependencies: Run the following commands to stop and mask the snmpd.service: # systemctl stop snmpd.service # systemctl mask snmpd.service."

It's designed to supply IP addressing and additional security to support the predicted growth of connected devices. IPv6 is based on 128-bit addressing and can support 340 undecillion, which is 340 trillion3 addresses. Features of IPv6 - Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure - Stateful and Stateless configuration - Support for quality of service (QoS) - An ideal protocol for neighboring node interaction."
    rationale: "IETF RFC 4038 recommends that applications are built with an assumption of dual stack. It is recommended that IPv6 be enabled and configured in accordance with Benchmark recommendations. -IF- dual stack and IPv6 are not used in your environment, IPv6 may be disabled to reduce the attack surface of the system, and recommendations pertaining to IPv6 can be skipped. Note: It is recommended that IPv6 be enabled and configured unless this is against local site policy."
    impact: "IETF RFC 4038 recommends that applications are built with an assumption of dual stack. When enabled, IPv6 will require additional configuration to reduce risk to the system. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "Enable or disable IPv6 in accordance with system requirements and local site policy."

    title: "Ensure bluetooth services are not in use."
    description: "Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between devices over short distances. It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections."
    rationale: "An attacker may be able to find a way to access or corrupt your data. One example of this type of activity is bluesnarfing, which refers to attackers using a Bluetooth connection to steal information off of your Bluetooth device. Also, viruses or other malicious code can take advantage of Bluetooth technology to infect other devices. If you are infected, your data may be corrupted, compromised, stolen, or lost."
    impact: "Many personal electronic devices (PEDs) use Bluetooth technology. For example, you may be able to operate your computer with a wireless keyboard. Disabling Bluetooth will prevent these devices from connecting to the system. There may be packages that are dependent on the bluez package. If the bluez package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the bluez package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system. -IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask bluetooth.service leaving the bluez package installed. Internal Only - General."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to stop bluetooth.service, and remove the bluez package: # systemctl stop bluetooth.service # apt purge bluez - OR - - IF - the bluez package is required as a dependency: Run the following commands to stop and mask bluetooth.service: # systemctl stop bluetooth.service # systemctl mask bluetooth.service Note: A reboot may be required."

    description: "Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of the chain."
    rationale: "There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue transversing the network stack. It is easier to white list acceptable usage than to black list unacceptable usage. Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over network can result in being locked out of the system."
    impact: "If configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of connectivity. Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base chain's policy to drop."
    remediation: "Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks to implement a default DROP policy: # nft chain <table family> <table name> <chain name> { policy drop \\; } Example: # nft chain inet filter input { policy drop \\; } # nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop \\; } # nft chain inet filter output { policy drop \\; }."

  # 5.1.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured. (Automated)
  - id: 28653
    title: "Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured."
    description: "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination. Internal Only - General."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax parameters above any Include and Match entries according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3 Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding.

  # 5.1.8 Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled. (Automated)
  - id: 28717
    title: "Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled."
    description: "The DisableForwarding parameter disables all forwarding features, including X11, ssh-agent(1), TCP and StreamLocal. This option overrides all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations. - X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote graphic connections. - ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh. - SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh-agent to authenticate them to other servers Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network. Internal Only - General."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

    title: "Ensure sshd LogLevel is configured."
    description: "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The DEBUG options are specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications. These levels provide so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information, and may violate the privacy of users."
    rationale: "The INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. The VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the LogLevel parameter to VERBOSE or INFO above any Include and Match entries as follows: LogLevel VERBOSE - OR - LogLevel INFO Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding.

    description: "pam_unix is the standard Unix authentication module. It uses standard calls from the system's libraries to retrieve and set account information as well as authentication. Usually this is obtained from the /etc/passwd and if shadow is enabled, the /etc/shadow file as well. The account component performs the task of establishing the status of the user's account and password based on the following shadow elements: expire, last_change, max_change, min_change, warn_change. In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD return, delay giving service to the user until they have established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed. The authentication component performs the task of checking the users credentials (password). The default action of this module is to not permit the user access to a service if their official password is blank."

    title: "Ensure minimum password length is configured."
    description: 'The minimum password length setting determines the lowers number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password". The minlen option sets the minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). Cannot be set to lower value than 6.'
    rationale: "Strong passwords help protect systems from password attacks. Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks, which attempt to use common words and phrases, and brute force attacks, which try every possible combination of characters. Also attackers may try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."
    impact: "In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren't hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents. Having a reasonable minimum length with no maximum character limit increases the resulting average password length used (and therefore the strength).6 Internal Only - General."

    description: "Password complexity can be set through: - minclass - The minimum number of classes of characters required in a new password.

    rationale: 'Strong passwords protect systems from being hacked through brute force methods. Requiring at least one non-alphabetic character increases the search space beyond pure dictionary words, which makes the resulting password harder to crack. Forcing users to choose an excessively complex password, e.g. some combination of upper-case, lower-case, numbers, and special characters, has a negative impact. It places an extra burden on users and many will use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a "special character" at the end). Attackers know this, so dictionary attacks will often contain these common patterns and use the most common substitutions like, $ for s, @ for a, 1 for l, 0 for o.'

    title: "Ensure password expiration is configured."
    description: "The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. PASS_MAX_DAYS <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)."
    rationale: "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity. We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden. Internal Only - General."
    impact: "The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password changes or users will be unable to change their password. Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to: Indication of compromise - - Change of user roles - When a user leaves the organization. Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but it’s also been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password."

If it is not possible to have a user set their own password immediately, and this recommendation or local site procedure may cause a user to continue using a third party generated password, PASS_MIN_DAYS for the effected user should be temporally changed to 0, to allow a user to change their password immediately.

    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
