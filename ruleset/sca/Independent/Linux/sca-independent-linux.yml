  # 1.1.1.8 Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited (Not Scored)
  - id: 33006
    title: "Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited."
    description: "The FAT filesystem format is primarily used on older windows systems and portable USB drives or flash modules. It comes in three types FAT12 , FAT16 , and FAT32 all of which are supported by the vfat kernel module."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: "The FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition. Disabling the vfat module can prevent boot on UEFI systems. FAT filesystems are often used on portable USB sticks and other flash media which are commonly used to transfer files between workstations, removing VFAT support may prevent the ability to transfer files in this way."
    remediation: "Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in .conf Example: vim etc/modprobe.d/vfat.conf install vfat /bin/true Run the following command to unload the vfat module: # rmmod vfat."

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Automated)
  - id: 33007
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid."

    description: "The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp . For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Impact: Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
