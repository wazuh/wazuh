      Irrespective of package source, PostgreSQL services can be identified because it typically
      includes the text string "postgresql". PGDG installs do not automatically register the service
      as a "want" of the default systemd target. Multiple instances of PostgreSQL services often
      distinguish themselves using a version number.

    rationale: >
      "The logging collector approach is often more useful than logging to syslog, since some
      types of messages might not appear in syslog output. One common example is dynamiclinker failure message; another may be error messages produced by scripts such as

      directory ($PGDATA) or as an absolute path. log_directory should be set according to your
      organization's logging policy.
    rationale: >
      If log_directory is not set, it is interpreted as the absolute path '/' and PostgreSQL will
      attempt to write its logs there (and typically fail due to a lack of permissions to that

      location as defined by your organization's logging policy.

  # 3.1.5 Ensure the filename pattern for log files is set correctly (Automated)
  - id: 24004
    title: Ensure the filename pattern for log files is set correctly
    description: >
      The log_filename setting specifies the filename pattern for log files. The value for
      log_filename should match your organization's logging policy.
      The value is treated as a strftime pattern, so %-escapes can be used to specify timevarying filenames. The supported %-escapes are similar to those listed in the Open Group's
      strftime specification. If you specify a filename without escapes, you should plan to use a
      log rotation utility to avoid eventually filling the partition that contains log_directory. If
      there are any time-zone-dependent %-escapes, the computation is done in the zone
      specified by log_timezone. Also, the system's strftime is not used directly, so platformspecific (nonstandard) extensions do not work.
      If CSV-format output is enabled in log_destination, .csv will be appended to the log
      filename. (If log_filename ends in .log, the suffix is replaced instead.)
    rationale: >
      If log_filename is not set, then the value of log_directory is appended to an empty string
      try to write to a directory instead of a file.

  # 3.1.6 Ensure the log file permissions are set correctly (Automated)
  - id: 24005
    title: Ensure the log file permissions are set correctly
    description: >
      The log_file_mode setting determines the file permissions for log files when
      logging_collector is enabled. The parameter value is expected to be a numeric mode
      specification in the form accepted by the chmod and umask system calls. (To use the
      customary octal format, the number must start with a 0 (zero).)
      The permissions should be set to allow only the necessary access to authorized personnel.
      In most cases the best setting is 0600, so that only the server owner can read or write the
      log files. The other commonly useful setting is 0640, allowing members of the owner's
      group to read the files, although to make use of that, you will need to alter the
      log_directory setting to store the log files outside the cluster data directory.

      inadvertently expose sensitive data to unauthorized personnel.

  # 3.1.7 Ensure 'log_truncate_on_rotation' is enabled (Automated)
  - id: 24006
    title: Ensure 'log_truncate_on_rotation' is enabled
    description: >
      "Enabling the log_truncate_on_rotation setting when logging_collector is enabled
      causes PostgreSQL to truncate (overwrite) existing log files with the same name during log
      rotation instead of appending to them. For example, using this setting in combination with
      a log_filename setting value like postgresql-%H.log would result in generating 24 hourly
      log files and then cyclically overwriting them:

      postgresql-00.log

      postgresql-01.log

      [...]

      postgresql-23.log

      Note: Truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened due to time-based
      rotation, not during server startup or size-based rotation (see later in this benchmark for
      size-based rotation details)."
    rationale: >
      If this setting is disabled, pre-existing log files will be appended to if log_filename is
      configured in such a way that static names are generated.
      Enabling or disabling the truncation should only be decided when also considering the
      value of log_filename and log_rotation_age/log_rotation_size.

    title: Ensure the maximum log file lifetime is set correctly
    description: >
      When logging_collector is enabled, the log_rotation_age parameter determines the
      maximum lifetime of an individual log file (depending on the value of log_filename). After
      this many minutes have elapsed, a new log file will be created via automatic log file
      rotation. Current best practices advise log rotation at least daily, but your organization's
      logging policy should dictate your rotation schedule.

      The log_line_prefix setting specifies a printf-style string that is prefixed to each log line.
      If blank, no prefix is used. You should configure this as recommended by the pgBadger
      development team unless directed otherwise by your organization's logging policy.

      % characters begin "escape sequences" that are replaced with status information as
      outlined below. Unrecognized escapes are ignored. Other characters are copied straight to
      the log line. Some escapes are only recognized by session processes and will be treated as
      empty by background processes such as the main server process. Status information may
      be aligned either left or right by specifying a numeric literal after the % and before the
      option. A negative value will cause the status information to be padded on the right with
      spaces to give it a minimum width, whereas a positive value will pad on the left. Padding
      can be useful to aid human readability in log files.
    rationale: >
      Properly setting log_line_prefix allows for adding additional information to each log

  ## 3.2 Ensure the PostgreSQL Audit Extension (pgAudit) is enabled (Automated)

    title: Ensure the PostgreSQL Audit Extension (pgAudit) is enabled
    description: >
      The PostgreSQL Audit Extension (pgAudit) provides detailed session and/or object audit
      logging via the standard PostgreSQL logging facility. The goal of pgAudit is to provide
      PostgreSQL users with the capability to produce audit logs often required to comply with
      government, financial, or ISO certifications.
    rationale: >
      Basic statement logging can be provided by the standard logging facility with
      log_statement = all. This is acceptable for monitoring and other uses but does not
      provide the level of detail generally required for an audit. It is not enough to have a list of
      all the operations performed against the database, it must also be possible to find
      particular statements that are of interest to an auditor. The standard logging facility shows
      what the user requested, while pgAudit focuses on the details of what happened while the
      database was satisfying the request.

      When logging SELECT and DML statements, pgAudit can be configured to log a separate entry
      for each relation referenced in a statement. No parsing is required to find all statements
      that touch a particular table. In fact, the goal is that the statement text is provided primarily
      for deep forensics and should not be required for an audit.
    remediation: |
      To install and enable pgAudit, simply install the appropriate rpm from the PGDG repo:

    description: >
      Install, configure, and use OpenSSL on a platform that has a NIST certified FIPS 140-2
      installation of OpenSSL. This provides PostgreSQL instances the ability to generate and
      validate cryptographic hashes to protect unclassified information requiring confidentiality
      and cryptographic protection, in accordance with the data owner's requirements.
    rationale: >
      Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-2 is a computer security
      standard developed by a U.S. Government and industry working group for validating the
      quality of cryptographic modules. Use of weak, or untested, encryption algorithms
      undermine the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. PostgreSQL uses OpenSSL
      for the underlying encryption layer.
      The database and application must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the
      higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they
      have been tested and validated. It is the responsibility of the data owner to assess the
      cryptography requirements in light of applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives,
      policies, regulations, and standards.
      For detailed information, refer to NIST FIPS Publication 140-2, Security Requirements for
      Cryptographic Modules. Note that the product's cryptographic modules must be validated
      and certified by NIST as FIPS-compliant. The security functions validated as part of FIPS
      140-2 for cryptographic modules are described in FIPS 140-2 Annex A. Currently only Red
      Hat Enterprise Linux is certified as a FIPS 140-2 distribution of OpenSSL. For other
      operating systems, users must obtain or build their own FIPS 140-2 OpenSSL libraries.

    title: Ensure the backup and restore tool, 'pgBackRest', is installed and configured
    description: >
      pgBackRest aims to be a simple, reliable backup and restore system that can seamlessly
      scale up to the largest databases and workloads. Instead of relying on traditional backup
      tools like tar and rsync, pgBackRest implements all backup features internally and uses a
      custom protocol for communicating with remote systems. Removing reliance on tar and
      rsync allows for better solutions to database-specific backup challenges. The custom
      remote protocol allows for more flexibility and limits the types of connections that are
      required to perform a backup which increases security.
    rationale: >
      The native PostgreSQL backup facility pg_dump provides adequate logical backup
      operations but does not provide for Point In Time Recovery (PITR). The PostgreSQL facility
      pg_basebackup performs physical backup of the database files and does provide for PITR,
      but it is constrained by single threading. Both of these methodologies are standard in the
      PostgreSQL ecosystem and appropriate for particular backup/recovery needs. pgBackRest
      offers another option with much more robust features and flexibility.
      pgBackRest is open-source software developed to perform efficient backups on PostgreSQL
      databases that measure in tens of terabytes and greater. It supports per file checksums,
      compression, partial/failed backup resume, high-performance parallel transfer,
      asynchronous archiving, tablespaces, expiration, full/differential/incremental,
      local/remote operation via SSH, hard-linking, restore, backup encryption, and more.
      pgBackRest is written in C and Perl and does not depend on rsync or tar but instead
      performs its own deltas which gives it maximum flexibility. Finally, pgBackRest provides an
      easy-to-use internal repository listing backup details accessible via the pgbackrest info
      command.
    remediation: >
      pgBackRest is not installed nor configured for PostgreSQL by default, but instead is
      maintained as a GitHub project. Fortunately, it is a part of the PGDG repository and can be
      easily installed:

      $ whoami

      root

      $ dnf -y install pgbackrest

      [snip]

      Installed:

      pgbackrest-2.31-1.rhel8.x86_64

      Complete!

      Once installed, pgBackRest must be configured for things like stanza name, backup
      location, retention policy, logging, etc. Please consult the configuration guide.
      If employing pgBackRest for your backup/recovery solution, ensure the repository, base
      backups, and WAL archives are stored on a reliable file system separate from the database
      server. Further, the external storage system where backups resided should have limited
      access to only those system administrators as necessary. Finally, as with any
      backup/recovery solution, stringent testing must be conducted. A backup is only good if
      it can be restored successfully.
