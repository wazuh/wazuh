    title: "Ensure 'Ad Hoc Distributed Queries' Server Configuration Option is set to '0'"
    description: "Enabling Ad Hoc Distributed Queries allows users to query data and execute statements on external data sources. This functionality should be disabled."

  - id: 12001
    title: "Ensure 'CLR Enabled' Server Configuration Option is set to '0'"
    description: "The clr enabled option specifies whether user assemblies can be run by SQL Server."

    title: "Ensure 'Cross DB Ownership Chaining' Server Configuration Option is set to '0'"
    description: "The cross db ownership chaining option controls cross-database ownership chaining across all databases at the instance (or server) level."
    rationale: "When enabled, this option allows a member of the db_owner role in a database to gain access to objects owned by a login in any other database, causing an unnecessary information disclosure. When required, cross-database ownership chaining should only be enabled for the specific databases requiring it instead of at the instance level for all databases by using the ALTER DATABASE <database_name> SET DB_CHAINING ON command.

    description: "The Database Mail XPs option controls the ability to generate and transmit email messages from SQL Server."

    description: "The Ole Automation Procedures option controls whether OLE Automation objects can be instantiated within Transact-SQL batches. These are extended stored procedures that allow SQL Server users to execute functions external to SQL Server."

    rationale: "Functionality can be abused to launch a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on remote servers by off-loading query processing to a target."

    title: "Ensure 'Remote Admin Connections' Server Configuration Option is set to '0'"
    description: "The remote admin connections option controls whether a client application on a remote computer can use the Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC)."
    rationale: 'The Dedicated Administrator Connection (DAC) lets an administrator access a running server to execute diagnostic functions or Transact-SQL statements, or to troubleshoot problems on the server, even when the server is locked or running in an abnormal state and not responding to a SQL Server Database Engine connection. In a cluster scenario, the administrator may not actually be logged on to the same node that is currently hosting the SQL Server instance and thus is considered "remote". Therefore, this setting should usually be enabled ( 1 ) for SQL Server failover clusters; otherwise it should be disabled ( 0 ) which is the default.'

    description: "The scan for startup procs option, if enabled, causes SQL Server to scan for and automatically run all stored procedures that are set to execute upon service startup."
    rationale: "Enforcing this control reduces the threat of an entity leveraging these facilities for malicious purposes."
    remediation: "Run the following T-SQL command: EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1; RECONFIGURE; EXECUTE sp_configure 'scan for startup procs', 0; RECONFIGURE; GO EXECUTE sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0; RECONFIGURE; Restart the Database Engine."

Administrators can also configure named instances to use TCP:1433 for communication. TCP:1433 is a widely known SQL Server port and this port assignment should be changed."
    rationale: "Using a non-default port helps protect the database from attacks directed to the default port."
    remediation: "1: In SQL Server Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand SQL Server Network Configuration, expand Protocols for <InstanceName> , and then double-click the TCP/IP or VIA protocol. 2: In the TCP/IP Properties dialog box, on the IP Addresses tab, several IP addresses appear in the format IP1 , IP2 , up to IPAll . One of these is for the IP address of the loopback adapter, 127.0.0.1 . Additional IP addresses appear for each IP Address on the computer. 3: Change the TCP Port field from 1433 to another non-standard port or leave the TCP Port field empty and set the TCP Dynamic Ports value to 0 to enable dynamic port assignment and then click OK. 4: In the console pane, click SQL Server Services. 5: In the details pane, right-click SQL Server (<InstanceName>) and then click Restart, to stop and restart SQL Server."
