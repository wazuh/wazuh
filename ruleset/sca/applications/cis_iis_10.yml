    description: "Web resources published through IIS are mapped, via Virtual Directories, to physical locations on disk. It is recommended to map all Virtual Directories to a non-system disk volume."
    rationale: "Isolating web content from system files may reduce the probability of: - Web sites/applications exhausting system disk space - File IO vulnerability in the web site/application from affecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of system files"
    remediation: "1. Browse to web content in C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\ 2. Copy or cut content onto a dedicated and restricted web folder on a non-systemdrive such as D:\\webroot\\ 3. Change mappings for any applications or Virtual Directories to reflect the new location To change the mapping for the application named app1 which resides under the Default Web Site, open IIS Manager: 1. Expand the server node 2. Expand Sites 3. Expand Default Web Site 4. Click on app1 5. In the Actions pane, select Basic Settings 6.

    description: "Directory browsing allows the contents of a directory to be displayed upon request from a web client. If directory browsing is enabled for a directory in Internet Information Services, users receive a page that lists the contents of the directory when the following two conditions are met: 1. No specific file is requested in the URL 2. The Default Documents feature is disabled in IIS, or if it is enabled, IIS is unable to locate a file in the directory that matches a name specified in the IIS default document list"
    rationale: "Ensuring that directory browsing is disabled may reduce the probability of disclosing sensitive content that is inadvertently accessible via IIS."

    title: "Ensure 'application pool identity' is configured for all application pools"
    description: "Application Pool Identities are the actual users/authorities that will run the worker process - w3wp.exe. Assigning the correct user authority will help ensure that applications can function properly, while not giving overly permissive permissions on the system. These identities can further be used in ACLs to protect system content. It is recommended that each Application Pool run under a unique identity. IIS has additional built-in least privilege identities intended for use by Application Pools. It is recommended that the default Application Pool Identity be changed to a least privilege principle other than Network Service. Furthermore, it is recommended that all application pool identities be assigned a unique least privilege principal. To achieve isolation in IIS, application pools can be run as separate identities. IIS can be configured to automatically use the application pool identity if no anonymous user account is configured for a Web site. This can greatly reduce the number of accounts needed for Web sites and make management of the accounts easier. It is recommended the Application Pool Identity be set as the Anonymous User Identity. The name of the Application Pool account corresponds to the name of the Application Pool. Application Pool Identities were introduced in Windows Server 2008 SP2. It is recommended that Application Pools be set to run as ApplicationPoolIdentity unless there is an underlying reason that the application pool needs to run as a specified end user account. One example where this is needed is for web farms using Kerberos authentication"
    rationale: "Setting Application Pools to use unique least privilege identities such as ApplicationPoolIdentity reduces the potential harm the identity could cause should the application ever become compromised. Additionally, it will simplify application pools configuration and account management."
    remediation: "To change the ApplicationPool identity to the built-in ApplicationPoolIdentity using AppCmd.exe, run the following from a command prompt: Enter the following command in AppCmd.exe to configure %systemroot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd set config /section:applicationPools /[name='<apppool name>'].processModel.identityType:ApplicationPoolIdentity "

    description: "IIS introduced a new security feature called Application Pool Identities that allows Application Pools to be run under unique accounts without the need to create and manage local or domain accounts. It is recommended that all Sites run under unique, dedicated Application Pools."
    rationale: "By setting sites to run under unique Application Pools, resource-intensive applications can be assigned to their own application pools which could improve server and application performance.In addition, it can help maintain application availability: if an application in one pool fails, applications in other pools are not affected.Last, isolating applications helps mitigate the potential risk of one application being allowed access to the resources of another application. It is also recommended to stop any application pool that is not in use or was created by an installation such as .Net 4.0."

This can greatly reduce the number of accounts needed for Web sites and make management of the accounts easier. It is recommended the Application Pool Identity be set as the Anonymous User Identity."
    rationale: "Configuring the anonymous user identity to use the application pool identity will help ensure site isolation - provided sites are set to use the application pool identity. Since a unique principal will run each application pool, it will ensure the identity is least privilege. Additionally, it will simplify Site management."

  # 2  Configure Authentication and Authorization
  - id: 22006
    title: "Ensure 'global authorization rule' is set to restrict access"
    description: "IIS introduced URL Authorization, which allows the addition of Authorization rules to the actual URL, instead of the underlying file system resource, as a way to protect it. Authorization rules can be configured at the server, web site, folder (including Virtual Directories), or file level. The native URL Authorization module applies to all requests, whether they are .NET managed or other types of files (e.g. static files or ASP files). It is recommended that URL Authorization be configured to only grant access to the necessary security principals."
    rationale: "Configuring a global Authorization rule that restricts access will ensure inheritance of the settings down through the hierarchy of web directories; if that content is copied elsewhere, the authorization rules flow with it. This will ensure access to current and future content is only granted to the appropriate principals, mitigating risk of accidental or unauthorized access."
    remediation: "To configure URL Authorization at the server level using command line utilities:Enter the following command in AppCmd.exe to configure: %systemroot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd set config -section:system.webServer/security/authorization /-\"[users='*',roles='',verbs='']\"; %systemroot%\\system32\\inetsrv\\appcmd set config -section:system.webServer/security/authorization /+\"[accessType='Allow',roles='Administrators']\""

    title: "Ensure access to sensitive site features is restricted to authenticated principals only"
    description: "IIS supports both challenge-based and login redirection-based authentication methods. Challenge-based authentication methods, such as Integrated Windows Authentication, require a client to respond correctly to a server-initiated challenge. A login redirection based authentication method such as Forms Authentication relies on redirection to a login page to determine the identity of the principal. Challenge-based authentication and login redirection-based authentication methods cannot be used in conjunction with one another. Public servers/sites are typically configured to use Anonymous Authentication. This method typically works, provided the content or services is intended for use by the public. When sites, applications, or specific content containers are not intended for anonymous public use, an appropriate authentication mechanism should be utilized. Authentication will help confirm the identity of clients who request access to sites, application, and content. IIS provides the following authentication modules by default: Anonymous Authentication - allows anonymous users to access sites, applications, and/or content Integrated Windows Authentication - authenticates users using the NTLM or Kerberos protocols; Kerberos v5 requires a connection to Active Directory ASP.NET Impersonation - allows ASP.NET applications to run under a security context different from the default security context for an application Forms Authentication - enables a user to login to the configured space with a valid user name and password which is then validated against a database or other credentials store Basic authentication - requires a valid user name and password to access content Client Certificate Mapping Authentication - allows automatic authentication of users who log on with client certificates that have been configured; requires SSL Digest Authentication - uses Windows domain controller to authenticate users who request accessNote that none of the challenge-based authentication modules can be used at the same time Forms Authentication is enabled for certain applications/content. Forms Authentication does not rely on IIS authentication, so anonymous access for the ASP.NET application can be configured if Forms Authentication will be used. It is recommended that sites containing sensitive information, confidential data, or non public web services be configured with a credentials-based authentication mechanism"
    rationale: "Configuring authentication will help mitigate the risk of unauthorized users accessing data and/or services, and in some cases reduce the potential harm that can be done to a system."

    description: "Forms-based authentication can pass credentials across the network in clear text. It is therefore imperative that the traffic between client and server be encrypted using SSL, especially in cases where the site is publicly accessible. It is recommended that communications with any portion of a site using Forms Authentication be encrypted using SSL."
    rationale: "Requiring SSL for Forms Authentication will protect the confidentiality of credentials during the login process, helping mitigate the risk of stolen user information."

    rationale: "Using cookies to manage session state may help mitigate the risk of session hi-jacking attempts by preventing ASP.NET from having to move session information to the URL. Moving session information identifiers into the URL may cause session IDs to show up in proxy logs, browsing history, and be accessible to client scripting via document.location."

Configuring this value enables the total request size to be restricted to a configured value. It is recommended that the overall size of requests be restricted to a maximum value appropriate for the server, site, or application."
    rationale: "Setting an appropriate value that has been tested for the maxAllowedContentLength filter will lower the impact an abnormally large request would otherwise have on IIS and/or web applications.

This header takes two parameters: max-age, "specifies the number of seconds, after the reception of the STS header field, during whichthe user agent regards the host (from whom the message was received) as a Known HSTSHost [speaks only HTTPS]"; and includeSubDomains. includeSubDomains is an optionaldirective that defines how this policy is applied to subdomains. If includeSubDomains isincluded in the header, it provides the following definition: this HSTS Policy also applies toany hosts whose domain names are subdomains of the Known HSTS Host''s domain name.'
    rationale: "HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a simple and widely supported standard to protect visitors by ensuring that their browsers always connect to a website over HTTPS. HSTS exists to remove the need for the common, insecure practice of redirecting users from http:// to https:// URLs. HSTS relies on the User Agent/Browser to enforce the required behavior. All major browsers support it. If the browser doesn't support HSTS, it will be ignored.When a browser knows that a domain has enabled HSTS, it does two things:1. Always uses an https:// connection, even when clicking on an http:// link or after typing a domain into the location bar without specifying a protocol.2. Removes the ability for users to click through warnings about invalid certificates.A domain instructs browsers that it has enabled HSTS by returning an HTTP header over an HTTPS connection."
