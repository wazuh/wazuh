  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition. (Automated)
  - id: 39003 
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment. <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.'

    rationale: "If the Legacy system-wide crypto policy is selected, it includes support for TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and SSH2 protocols or later. The algorithms DSA, 3DES, and RC4 are allowed, while RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if larger than 1023-bits. These legacy protocols and algorithms can make the system vulnerable to attacks, including those listed in RFC 7457."
    impact: "Environments that require compatibility with older insecure protocols may require the use of the less secure LEGACY policy level."
    remediation: "Run the following command to change the system-wide crypto policy # update-crypto-policies --set <CRYPTO POLICY> Example: # update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT Run the following to make the updated system-wide crypto policy active # update-crypto-policies."

    title: "Ensure net-snmp is not installed."
    description: 'Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.'
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: - The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values. -."

It provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend or provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables utility. firewalld replaces iptables as the default firewall management tool. Use the firewalld utility to configure a firewall for less complex firewalls. The utility is easy to use and covers the typical use cases scenario. FirewallD supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. Note: Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program."

System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

    description: "Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules. All the loading / listing / dependency checking of modules is done by kmod via symbolic links. The following system calls control loading and unloading of modules: - init_module - load a module - finit_module - load a module (used when the overhead of using cryptographically signed modules to determine the authenticity of a module can be avoided) - delete_module - delete a module - create_module - create a loadable module entry - query_module - query the kernel for various bits pertaining to modules Any execution of the loading and unloading module programs and system calls will trigger an audit record with an identifier of modules."
    rationale: "Monitoring the use of all the various ways to manipulate kernel modules could provide system administrators with evidence that an unauthorized change was made to a kernel module, possibly compromising the security of the system."

  # 5.2.13 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 39171 
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 39178 
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. - ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk. - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is no greater than 900 seconds (15 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 0 - At the 15 minute interval, if the ssh session is inactive, the session will be terminated."
    impact: "In some cases this setting may cause termination of long-running scripts over SSH or remote automation tools which rely on SSH. In developing the local site policy, the requirements of such scripts should be considered and appropriate ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings should be calculated to insure operational continuity."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. This should include ClientAliveInterval between 1 and 900 and ClientAliveCountMax of 0: ClientAliveInterval 900 ClientAliveCountMax 0."
