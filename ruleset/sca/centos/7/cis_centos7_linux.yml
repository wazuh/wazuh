    impact: 'Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap. Snap is a package manager for Linux for installing Snap packages. "Snap" application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software''s end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well.'

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 6003
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily."
    remediation: "Create or update an entry for /tmp in either /etc/fstab OR in a systemd tmp.mount file: If /etc/fstab is used: configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 Run the following command to remount /tmp # mount -o remount,noexec,nodev,nosuid /tmp OR if systemd tmp.mount file is used: run the following command to create the file /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount if it doesn't exist: # [ ! -f /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount ] && cp -v /usr/lib/systemd/system/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/ Edit the file /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon: # systemctl daemon-reload Run the following command to unmask and start tmp.mount: # systemctl --now unmask tmp.mount."

In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated.

    title: "Ensure XD/NX support is enabled."
    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."
    rationale: "Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system. Note: Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your hardware."

    title: "Ensure no unconfined services exist."
    description: "Unconfined processes run in unconfined domains Note: Occasionally certain daemons such as backup or centralized management software may require running unconfined. Any such software should be carefully analyzed and documented before such an exception is made."
    rationale: "For unconfined processes, SELinux policy rules are applied, but policy rules exist that allow processes running in unconfined domains almost all access. Processes running in unconfined domains fall back to using DAC rules exclusively. If an unconfined process is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security enhancement on top of DAC rules - it does not replace them."
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them."

    description: 'Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.'
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: - The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values. -."

  - id: 6078
    title: "Ensure source routed packets are not accepted."
    description: "In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."
    rationale: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route, net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route, net.ipv6.conf.all.accept_source_route and net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."

    title: "Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled."
    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

It provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the iptables backend or provides firewall features by acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables utility. firewalld replaces iptables as the default firewall management tool. Use the firewalld utility to configure a firewall for less complex firewalls. The utility is easy to use and covers the typical use cases scenario. FirewallD supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles. Note: Starting in v0.6.0, FirewallD added support for acting as a front-end for the Linux kernel's netfilter framework via the nftables userspace utility, acting as an alternative to the nft command line program."

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

  # 4.2.2.1 Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog. (Automated)
  - id: 6139
    title: "Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog."
    description: 'Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export. Notes: - This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, "Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host" has been implemented. - The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters - As noted in the journald man pages: journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system.'
    rationale: "Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line: ForwardToSyslog=yes."

  # 5.3.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 6168
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. - ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk. - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is no greater than 900 seconds (15 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 0 - At the 15 minute interval, if the ssh session is inactive, the session will be terminated."
    impact: "In some cases this setting may cause termination of long-running scripts over SSH or remote automation tools which rely on SSH. In developing the local site policy, the requirements of such scripts should be considered and appropriate ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings should be calculated to insure operational continuity."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. This should include ClientAliveInterval between 1 and 900 and ClientAliveCountMax of 0: ClientAliveInterval 900 ClientAliveCountMax 0."

  # 5.3.20 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 6172
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."

The following are definitions of the pam_pwquality.so options. The following options are set in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file: Password Length: - minlen = 14 - password must be 14 characters or more Password complexity: - minclass = 4 - The minimum number of required classes of characters for the new password (digits, uppercase, lowercase, others) OR - dcredit = -1 - provide at least one digit - ucredit = -1 - provide at least one uppercase character - ocredit = -1 - provide at least one special character - lcredit = -1 - provide at least one lowercase character The following is set in the /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth files - try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password. - retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure. The settings shown above are one possible policy.

    description: 'Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. These settings are commonly configured with the pam_faillock.so module. Some environments may continue using the pam_tally2.so module, where this older method may simplify automation in mixed environments. Set the lockout number in deny= to the policy in effect at your site. unlock_time=_n_ is the number of seconds the account remains locked after the number of attempts configured in deny=_n_ has been met. Notes: - Additional module options may be set, recommendation only covers those listed here. - When modifying authentication configuration using the authconfig utility, the system-auth and password-auth files are overwritten with the settings from the authconfig utility. This can be avoided by creating symbolic links in place of the configuration files, which authconfig recognizes and does not overwrite. These symbolic links are the default for Fedora 19 derived distributions. - Use of the "audit" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during - authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization. If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_faillock.so or the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing following commands. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user. If pam_faillock.so is used: o o # faillock --user <username> --reset o o # pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset If pam_tally2.so is used:.'

    rationale: "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials via a brute force attack, using already compromised credentials, or gaining the credentials by other means, can be limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password can also reduce an attacker's window of opportunity.

This should not be considered a replacement for proper implementation of these policies and practices.

  # 6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords. (Automated)
  - id: 6193
    title: "Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords."
    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Notes: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
    remediation: "If any accounts in the /etc/passwd file do not have a single x in the password field, run the following command to set these accounts to use shadowed passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."

    description: "An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as that user without providing a password."
    rationale: "All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user."
    remediation: "If any accounts in the /etc/shadow file do not have a password, run the following command to lock the account until it can be determined why it does not have a password: # passwd -l <username> Also, check to see if the account is logged in and investigate what it is being used for to determine if it needs to be forced off."
