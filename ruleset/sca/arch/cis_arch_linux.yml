      '
    rationale: 'Even though the .rhosts files are ineffective if support is disabled
      in /etc/pam.conf, disabling the ability to use .rhosts files in SSH provides an

    title: Disable Automounting.
    description: autofs allows automatic mounting of devices, typically including CD/DVDs
      and USB drives.
    rationale: With automounting enabled anyone with physical access could attach a
      USB drive or disc and have its contents available in system even if they lacked
      permissions to mount it themselves.
    impact: 'The use of portable hard drives is very common for workstation users. If
      your organization allows the use of portable storage or media on workstations
      and physical access controls to workstations is considered adequate there is little
      value add in turning off automounting. Notes: Additional methods of disabling
      a service exist. Consult your distribution documentation for appropriate methods.
      This control should align with the tolerance of the use of portable drives and
      optical media in the organization. On a server requiring an admin to manually
      mount media can be part of defense-in-depth to reduce the risk of unapproved software
      or information being introduced or proprietary software or information being exfiltrated.
      If admins commonly use flash drives and Server access has sufficient physical
      controls, requiring manual mounting may not increase security.'
    remediation: 'Run one of the following commands to disable autofs : # chkconfig
      autofs off # systemctl disable autofs # update-rc.d autofs disable.'

    title: Disable USB Storage.
    description: USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files insuring persistence
      and availability of the files independent of network connection status. Its popularity
      and utility has led to USB-based malware being a simple and common means for network
      infiltration and a first step to establishing a persistent threat within a networked
      environment.
    rationale: Restricting USB access on the system will decrease the physical attack
      surface for a device and diminish the possible vectors to introduce malware.
    remediation: 'Edit or create a file in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory ending in
      .conf Example: vim /etc/modprobe.d/usb-storage.conf and add the following line:

    title: Ensure /tmp is configured.
    description: The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary
      storage by all users and some applications.
    rationale: Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec
      option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable
      code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system
      setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the
      hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program.
      If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue
      to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to
      /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp.
    impact: Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk
      of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out
      of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it,
      but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole
      disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a
      RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can
      lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utalizing
      tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the
      tmp.mount file.
    remediation:
      'Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime
      0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask
      tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount
      to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid.'

    title: Ensure separate partition exists for /var/tmp.
    description: The /var/tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary
      storage by all users and some applications.
    rationale: Since the /var/tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there
      is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In
      addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the
      noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install
      executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink
      to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was
      updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy
      of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the
      attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.
    remediation: For new installations, during installation create a custom partition
      setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp . For systems that were previously
      installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate.

    title: Ensure login and logout events are collected.
    description: Monitor login and logout events. The parameters below track changes
      to files associated with login/logout events. The file /var/log/faillog tracks
      failed events from login. The file /var/log/lastlog maintain records of the last
      time a user successfully logged in. The file /var/log/tallylog maintains records
      of failures via the pam_tally2 module.

    title: Ensure session initiation information is collected.
    description: Monitor session initiation events. The parameters in this section track
      changes to the files associated with session events. The file /var/run/utmp tracks
      all currently logged in users. All audit records will be tagged with the identifier
      "session." The /var/log/wtmp file tracks logins, logouts, shutdown, and reboot
      events. The file /var/log/btmp keeps track of failed login attempts and can be
      read by entering the command /usr/bin/last -f /var/log/btmp All audit records
      will be tagged with the identifier "logins.".
    rationale: Monitoring these files for changes could alert a system administrator

      a user logging in at a time when they do not normally log in).

    description: Monitor changes to file permissions, attributes, ownership and group.
      The parameters in this section track changes for system calls that affect file
      permissions and attributes. The chmod , fchmod and fchmodat system calls affect
      the permissions associated with a file. The chown , fchown , fchownat and lchown
      system calls affect owner and group attributes on a file. The setxattr , lsetxattr
      , fsetxattr (set extended file attributes) and removexattr , lremovexattr , fremovexattr
      (remove extended file attributes) control extended file attributes. In all cases,
      an audit record will only be written for non-system user ids (auid >= 500) and
      will ignore Daemon events (auid = 4294967295). All audit records will be tagged
      with the identifier "perm_mod.".
    rationale: Monitoring for changes in file attributes could alert a system administrator

    title: Ensure successful file system mounts are collected.
    description: Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount) system
      call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below
      configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used
      by a non-privileged user.
    rationale: It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems
      to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence
      that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of
      the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively
      indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to
      determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat
      and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point
      of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write
      occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes
      to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit
      log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track
      data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.
    remediation: 'For 32 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/
      directory ending in .rules Example: vi /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules and add
      the following lines: -a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S mount -F auid>=500 -F auid!=4294967295
      -k mounts For 64 bit systems Edit or create a file in the /etc/audit/rules.d/

      -k mounts Notes: This tracks successful and unsuccessful mount commands. File
      system mounts do not have to come from external media and this action still does
      not verify write (e.g. CD ROMS). Reloading the auditd config to set active settings
      may require a system reboot.'

    title: Ensure file deletion events by users are collected.
    description: Monitor the use of system calls associated with the deletion or renaming
      of files and file attributes. This configuration statement sets up monitoring

      the identifier "delete".
    rationale: Monitoring these calls from non-privileged users could provide a system
      administrator with evidence that inappropriate removal of files and file attributes

    title: Ensure the audit configuration is immutable.
    description: Set system audit so that audit rules cannot be modified with auditctl.
      Setting the flag "-e 2" forces audit to be put in immutable mode. Audit changes
      can only be made on system reboot.
    rationale: In immutable mode, unauthorized users cannot execute changes to the audit
      system to potentially hide malicious activity and then put the audit rules back.
      Users would most likely notice a system reboot and that could alert administrators
      of an attempt to make unauthorized audit changes.
    remediation: 'Edit or create the file /etc/audit/rules.d/99-finalize.rules and add
      the line -e 2 at the end of the file Notes: This setting will ensure reloading
      the auditd config to set active settings requires a system reboot.'

      logs to local disk on the server they are protected from loss.

      to black list unacceptable usage.

    title: Ensure secure ICMP redirects are not accepted.
    description: Secure ICMP redirects are the same as ICMP redirects, except they come
      from gateways listed on the default gateway list. It is assumed that these gateways
      are known to your system, and that they are likely to be secure.
    rationale: It is still possible for even known gateways to be compromised. Setting
      net.ipv4.conf.all.secure_redirects to 0 protects the system from routing table
      updates by possibly compromised known gateways.

    title: Ensure broadcast ICMP requests are ignored.
    description: Setting net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts to 1 will cause the system
      to ignore all ICMP echo and timestamp requests to broadcast and multicast addresses.
    rationale: Accepting ICMP echo and timestamp requests with broadcast or multicast
      destinations for your network could be used to trick your host into starting (or
      participating) in a Smurf attack. A Smurf attack relies on an attacker sending
      large amounts of ICMP broadcast messages with a spoofed source address. All hosts
      receiving this message and responding would send echo-reply messages back to the
      spoofed address, which is probably not routable. If many hosts respond to the
      packets, the amount of traffic on the network could be significantly multiplied.

    description: The freevxfs filesystem type is a free version of the Veritas type
      filesystem. This is the primary filesystem type for HP-UX operating systems.
    rationale: Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack
      surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it.

    title: Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate.
    description: INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH
      users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine
      when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate
      those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. VERBOSE level specifies
      that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key
      used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management,
      especially in legacy environments.
    rationale: SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity.
      DEBUG is specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications
      since it provides so much data that it is difficult to identify important security
      information.

    title: Ensure only strong Ciphers are used.
    description: This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication.
    rationale: Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module
      cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data
      may be compromised The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH,
      have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier
      for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a
      long-duration encrypted session, aka a "Sweet32" attack The RC4 algorithm, as
      used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data
      with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote
      attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a
      stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by
      the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values,
      aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted
      with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the
      session Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block
      cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote
      attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext
      in an SSH session via unknown vectors The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c,
      when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC
      context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
      ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted
      callback address.

    rationale: The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials
      or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited
      by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password
      also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity.

    title: Ensure password expiration warning days is 7 or more.
    description: The PASS_WARN_AGE parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator
      to notify users that their password will expire in a defined number of days. It
      is recommended that the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter be set to 7 or more days.
    rationale: Providing an advance warning that a password will be expiring gives users
      time to think of a secure password. Users caught unaware may choose a simple password
      or write it down where it may be discovered.
    remediation: 'Set the PASS_WARN_AGE parameter to 7 in /etc/login.defs : PASS_WARN_AGE
      7 Modify user parameters for all users with a password set to match: # chage --warndays
      7 <user> Notes: You can also check this setting in /etc/shadow directly. The 6th
      field should be 7 or more for all users with a password.'

    title: Ensure access to the su command is restricted.
    description: The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user.
      The program has been superseded by sudo , which allows for more granular control
      over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user.
      By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su , the su command will
      only allow users in the wheel group to execute su.
    rationale: Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system
      administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute
      privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit
      mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only
      record that a user executed the su program.
    remediation: 'Add the following line to the /etc/pam.d/su file: auth required pam_wheel.so
      use_uid Create a comma separated list of users in the wheel statement in the /etc/group
      file: wheel:x:10:root,<user list>.'

    description: Configure /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow to allow specific users

      /etc/at.deny and /etc/cron.deny are checked. Any user not specifically defined
      in those files is allowed to use at and cron. By removing the files, only users
      in /etc/cron.allow and /etc/at.allow are allowed to use at and cron. Note that
      even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow , cron jobs can still be
      run as that user. The cron.allow file only controls administrative access to the
      crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs.
    rationale: On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule
      cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces
      this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny
      list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to
      the deny files.

      in root 's executable path makes it likely that an attacker can gain superuser
      access by forcing an administrator operating as root to execute a Trojan horse
      program.
    remediation: Correct or justify any items discovered in the Audit step.

      pose a threat to system security since group permissions are not properly managed.

    description: Although the useradd program will not let you create a duplicate user
      name, it is possible for an administrator to manually edit the /etc/passwd file
      and change the user name.
    rationale: If a user is assigned a duplicate user name, it will create and have
      access to files with the first UID for that username in /etc/passwd . For example,
      if "test4" has a UID of 1000 and a subsequent "test4" entry has a UID of 2000,
      logging in as "test4" will use UID 1000. Effectively, the UID is shared, which
      is a security problem.
    remediation: Based on the results of the audit script, establish unique user names
      for the users. File ownerships will automatically reflect the change as long as
      the users have unique UIDs.

    title: Ensure shadow group is empty.
    description: The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability
      to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group.
    rationale: Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to
      the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file,
      they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to
      break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file
      (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts.
    remediation: Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group
      of any users with shadow as their primary group.

    title: Ensure permissions on /etc/hosts.deny are configured.
    description: The /etc/hosts.deny file contains network information that is used
      by many system applications and therefore must be readable for these applications
      to operate.
    rationale: It is critical to ensure that the /etc/hosts.deny file is protected from
      unauthorized write access. Although it is protected by default, the file permissions
      could be changed either inadvertently or through malicious actions.
    remediation: 'Run the following commands to set permissions on /etc/hosts.deny :
      # chown root:root /etc/hosts.deny # chmod 644 /etc/hosts.deny.'

    title: Ensure chrony is configured.
    description: chrony is a daemon which implements the Network Time Protocol (NTP)
      is designed to synchronize system clocks across a variety of systems and use a
      source that is highly accurate. More information on chrony can be found at http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/.
      chrony can be configured to be a client and/or a server.
    rationale: If chrony is in use on the system proper configuration is vital to ensuring
      time synchronization is working properly. This recommendation only applies if
      chrony is in use on the system.
    remediation: 'Add or edit server or pool lines to /etc/chrony.conf as appropriate:
      server <remote-server> Configure chrony to run as the chrony user by configuring
      the appropriate startup script for your distribution. Startup scripts are typically
      stored in /etc/init.d or /etc/systemd.'
