    description: "The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A squashfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: 'As Snap packages utilizes squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software''s end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ("App store"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment.'

  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition. (Automated)
  - id: 31002
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0 Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment. <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follows. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

Since the /var/tmp directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/tmp and cause potential disruption to daemons as the disk is full. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var/tmp as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection from exploitation An example of exploiting /var/tmp may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  # 1.1.7.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /home. (Automated)
  - id: 31021
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /home."
    description: "The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /home on a separate partition is as follows. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /home directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home and impact all local users. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of /home options such as usrquota/grpquota may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. Protection of user data As /home contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    description: "The /dev/shm directory is a world-writable directory that can function as shared memory that facilitates inter process communication (IPC)."
    rationale: "Making /dev/shm its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by mounting tmpfs to /dev/shm."
    impact: "Since the /dev/shm directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. /dev/shm utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."

    description: "Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report generators."
    rationale: "Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system activity. Attackers may replace the audit tools or inject code into the existing tools with the purpose of providing the capability to hide or erase system activity from the audit logs. Audit tools should be cryptographically signed in order to provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified, manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or files."
    remediation: "Add or update the following selection lines for to a file ending in .conf in the /etc/aide.conf.d/ directory or to /etc/aide.conf to protect the integrity of the audit tools: # Audit Tools /sbin/auditctl p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512 /sbin/auditd p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512 /sbin/ausearch p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512 /sbin/aureport p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512 /sbin/autrace p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512 /sbin/augenrules p+i+n+u+g+s+b+acl+xattrs+sha512."

    description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters."
    rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
    impact: 'If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c" If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.'

On newer grub2 systems the encrypted bootloader password is contained in user.cfg. If the system uses UEFI, /boot/efi is a vfat filesystem. The vfat filesystem itself doesn't have the concept of permissions but can be mounted under Linux with whatever permissions desired."
    rationale: "Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them."

If an unconfined process is compromised, SELinux does not prevent an attacker from gaining access to system resources and data, but of course, DAC rules are still used. SELinux is a security enhancement on top of DAC rules - it does not replace them."
    remediation: "Investigate any unconfined processes found during the audit action. They may need to have an existing security context assigned to them or a policy built for them."

While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems. Note: - This recommendation is designed around the postfix mail server. - Depending on your environment you may have an alternative MTA installed such as sendmail. If this is the case consult the documentation for your installed MTA to configure the recommended state."

    title: "Ensure nftables default deny firewall policy."
    description: "Base chain policy is the default verdict that will be applied to packets reaching the end of the chain."
    rationale: "There are two policies: accept (Default) and drop. If the policy is set to accept, the firewall will accept any packet that is not configured to be denied and the packet will continue traversing the network stack. It is easier to explicitly permit acceptable usage than to deny unacceptable usage. Note: Changing firewall settings while connected over the network can result in being locked out of the system."
    impact: "If configuring nftables over ssh, creating a base chain with a policy of drop will cause loss of connectivity. Ensure that a rule allowing ssh has been added to the base chain prior to setting the base chain's policy to drop."
    remediation: "If NFTables utility is in use on your system: Run the following command for the base chains with the input, forward, and output hooks to implement a default DROP policy: # nft chain <table family> <table name> <chain name> { policy drop \\; } Example: # nft chain inet filter input { policy drop \\; } # nft chain inet filter forward { policy drop \\; }."

    description: "Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters monitors the following system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit: - sethostname - set the systems host name - setdomainname - set the systems domain name The files being monitored are: - /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net - messages displayed pre-login - /etc/hosts - file containing host names and associated IP addresses - /etc/sysconfig/network - additional information that is valid to all network interfaces - /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ - directory containing network interface scripts and configurations files."
    rationale: "Monitoring sethostname and setdomainname will identify potential unauthorized changes to host and domainname of a system. The changing of these names could potentially break security parameters that are set based on those names. The /etc/hosts file is monitored for changes that can indicate an unauthorized intruder is trying to change machine associations with IP addresses and trick users and processes into connecting to unintended machines. Monitoring /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is important, as intruders could put disinformation into those files and trick users into providing information to the intruder. Monitoring /etc/sysconfig/network is important as it can show if network interfaces or scripts are being modified in a way that can lead to the machine becoming unavailable or compromised. All audit records should have a relevant tag associated with them."

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

  - id: 31117
    title: "Ensure rsyslog default file permissions are configured."
    description: "RSyslog will create logfiles that do not already exist on the system. This setting controls what permissions will be applied to these newly created files."
    rationale: "It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected."
    impact: "The systems global umask could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the FileCreateMode directive. RSyslog also has it's own $umask directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how FileCreateMode is used. Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in /etc/rsyslog.conf, /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf files and that FileCreateMode is set before any file is created."
    remediation: "Edit either /etc/rsyslog.conf or a dedicated .conf file in /etc/rsyslog.d/ and set $FileCreateMode to 0640 or more restrictive: $FileCreateMode 0640 Restart the service: # systemctl restart rsyslog."

The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable. If a system administrator wants to restrict user access further by only allowing the allowed users to log in from a particular host, the entry can be specified in the form of user@host. - AllowGroups: o The AllowGroups variable gives the system administrator the option of allowing specific groups of users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated group names. Numeric group IDs are not recognized with this variable. - DenyUsers: o The DenyUsers variable gives the system administrator the option of denying specific users to ssh into the system. The list consists of space separated user names. Numeric user IDs are not recognized with this variable.

    description: "INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system.

This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 31152
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. - ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk. - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is no greater than 900 seconds (15 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 0 - At the 15 minute interval, if the ssh session is inactive, the session will be terminated."
    impact: "In some cases this setting may cause termination of long-running scripts over SSH or remote automation tools which rely on SSH. In developing the local site policy, the requirements of such scripts should be considered and appropriate ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings should be calculated to insure operational continuity."

    rationale: "Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands.

  # 6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords (Automated)
  - id: 31181
    title: "Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords."
    description: "Local accounts can use shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, the passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
    remediation: "Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."
