  - id: 38500
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment. <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var."
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follows. Protection from resource exhaustion The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior.

If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

Fine grained control over the mount Configuring /var/log as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev.

  # 1.1.8.1 Ensure /dev/shm is a separate partition. (Automated)
  - id: 38522
    title: "Ensure /dev/shm is a separate partition."
    description: "The /dev/shm directory is a world-writable directory that can function as shared memory that facilitates inter process communication (IPC)."
    rationale: "Making /dev/shm its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /dev/shm useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by mounting tmpfs to /dev/shm."
    impact: "Since the /dev/shm directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. /dev/shm utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "For specific configuration requirements of the /dev/shm mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /dev/shm defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0 tmpfs."

    title: "Ensure rpcbind is not installed or the rpcbind services are masked."
    description: "The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."
    rationale: "A small request (~82 bytes via UDP) sent to the Portmapper generates a large response (7x to 28x amplification), which makes it a suitable tool for DDoS attacks. If rpcbind is not required, it is recommended that the rpcbind package be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system."
    impact: "Many of the libvirt packages used by Enterprise Linux virtualization, and the nfs-utils package used for The Network File System (NFS), are dependent on the rpcbind package. If the rpcbind package is required as a dependency, the services rpcbind.service and rpcbind.socket should be stopped and masked to reduce the attack surface of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove nfs-utils: # dnf remove rpcbind OR If the rpcbind package is required as a dependency, run the following commands to stop and mask the rpcbind.service and rpcbind.socket systemd units: # systemctl --now mask rpcbind.service # systemctl --now mask rpcbind.socket."

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user."
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

    rationale: "It is important to ensure that log files have the correct permissions to ensure that sensitive data is archived and protected."
    impact: "The systems global umask could override, but only making the file permissions stricter, what is configured in RSyslog with the FileCreateMode directive. RSyslog also has its own $umask directive that can alter the intended file creation mode. In addition, consideration should be given to how FileCreateMode is used. Thus it is critical to ensure that the intended file creation mode is not overridden with less restrictive settings in /etc/rsyslog.conf, /etc/rsyslog.d/*conf files and that FileCreateMode is set before any file is created."

  # 5.2.13 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 38641
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 38648
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "NOTE: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not, and never had, intentionally the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus may no longer be abused to disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
    remediation: "Edit or create a file ending in *.conf in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ directory or the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and set the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax parameters according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3 Edit files ending in *.conf in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ directory and the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file and remove occurrences of the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax parameters not in accordance with local site policy.

If not available, then prompt the user for a password. - retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure. - minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more Either of the following can be used to enforce complex passwords: - minclass=4 - provide at least four classes of characters for the new password OR - dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit - ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character - ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character - lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character The settings shown above are one possible policy.

  # 6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords. (Automated)
  - id: 38676
    title: "Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords."
    description: "Local accounts can use shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, the passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
    remediation: "Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."

    title: "Ensure root is the only UID 0 account."
    description: "Any account with UID 0 has superuser privileges on the system."
    rationale: "This access must be limited to only the default root account and only from the system console. Administrative access must be through an unprivileged account using an approved mechanism as noted in Item 5.6 Ensure access to the su command is restricted."
    remediation: "Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate."
