  description: "This document, CIS Oracle Solaris 11.4 Benchmark v1.0.0, provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Oracle Solaris 11.4 on both x86 and SPARC platforms. This guide was tested against  Solaris 11.4 release, updated to the Software Repository Update 5 (SRU5). As of the publication of this document, Solaris 11.4 SRU5 is the latest available support update for the Solaris 11 OS. The recommendations included in this document may need to beadjusted for future Solaris 11 updates."

    title: "Configure TCP Wrappers."
    description: "TCP Wrappers is a host-based access control system that allows administrators to control who has access to various network services based on the IP address of the remote end of the connection. TCP Wrappers also provide logging information via syslog about both successful and unsuccessful connections."
    rationale: "TCP Wrappers provides granular control over what services can be accessed over the network. Its logs show attempted access to services from non-authorized systems,which can help identify unauthorized access attempts."
    remediation: 'To disable this service, run the following commands: # inetadm -M tcp_wrappers=TRUE && echo "ALL: <net>/<mask>, <net/<mask>, …" > /etc/hosts.allow\ && echo "ALL: ALL" >/etc/hosts.deny'

    description: "The graphical login service provides the capability of logging into the system using an X- windows type interface from the console. If graphical login access for the console is required, leave the service in local-only mode."
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    title: "Configure sendmail Service for Local-Only Mode."
    description: "In Solaris 11, the sendmail service is set to local only mode by default. This means that users on remote systems cannot connect to the sendmail service, eliminating the possibility of a remote exploit attack against some future sendmail vulnerability. Leaving sendmail in local-only mode permits mail to be sent out from the local system. If the localsystem will not be processing or sending any mail, this service can be disabled. However, if sendmail is disabled completely,emailmessages sent to the root account (such as cron job output or audit service warnings) will fail to be delivered. Analternative approach is to disable the sendmail service and create a cron job to process all mail that is queued on the localsystem, sending it to a relay host defined in the sendmail.cf file. It is recommended that sendmail be left in local-only modeunless there is a specific requirement to completely disable it."
    rationale: "The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of security issues. While itis important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listeningon a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems."
    remediation: "Run the following to set sendmail to listen only local interfaces: # svccfg -v -s svc:/network/smtp:sendmail setprop config/local_only=false    # svcadm refresh sendmail    # svcadm restart sendmail"

    title: "Disable RPC Encryption Key."
    description: 'The keyserv service is only required for sites that are using the Secure RPC mechanism. The most common use for Secure RPC on Solaris machines is "secure NFS", which uses the Secure RPC mechanism to provide higher levels of securitythan the standard NFS protocols. ("Secure NFS" is unrelated to Kerberos authentication as a mechanism for providing higherlevels of NFS security. "Kerberized" NFS does not require the keyserv service to be running.)'
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    description: "The GSS API is a security abstraction layer that is designed to make it easier for developers to integrate with different authentication schemes. It is most commonly used in applications for sites that use Kerberos for network authentication, though it can also allow applications to interoperate with other authentication schemes."
    rationale: "GSS does not expose anything external to the system as it is configured to use TLI (protocol = ticotsord) by default. This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    description: "If the local site is not using the NIS naming service to distribute system and user configuration information, this service may be disabled. This service is disabled by default unless the NIS service has been installed and configured on the system."
    rationale: "As RPC-based services such as NIS may use non-secure authentication and share sensitive network object information with systems and applications using RPC-based service, NIS client daemons should be disabled. Users are encouraged to use LDAP as a name service in place of NIS."
    remediation: "To disable this service, run the following commands: # svcadm disable svc:/network/nis/client. If LDAP is not in use also disable nis/domain: # svcadm disable svc:/network/nis/domain"

Typically there are only a small number of NIS servers on any given network. These services are disabled by default unless the system has been previously configured to act as a NIS server."
    rationale: "As RPC-based services such as NIS may use non-secure authentication and share sensitive network object information with systems and applications using RPC-based services, this service should be disabled. Users are encouraged to use LDAP as a name service in place of NIS."

    title: "Disable Removable Volume Manager (rmvolmgr - Scored)."
    description: "The HAL-aware removable volume manager in the Solaris 11 OS automatically mounts external devices for users whenever the device is attached to the system. These devices include CD-R, CD-RW, floppies, DVD, USB and 1394 mass storage devices. See the rmvolmgr(1M) manual page for more details."
    rationale: "Allowing users to mount and access data from removable media devices makes it easier for malicious programs and data to be imported onto the network. It also introduces the risk that sensitive data may be transferred off the system without a log record. By adding rmvolmgr to the .xinitrc file, user-isolated instances of rmvolmgr can be run via a session startup script. In such cases, the rmvolmgr instance will not allow management of volumes that belong to other than the owner of the startup script. When a user logs onto the workstation console (/dev/console), any instance of user-initiated rmvolmgr will only own locally connected devices, such as CD-ROMs or flash memory hardware, locally connected to USB or FireWire ports."

However, the automount daemon can also be configured to mount local (loopback) file systems as well, which may include local user home directories, depending on the system configuration."
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    title: "Enable Strong TCP Sequence Number Generation."
    description: "The variable TCP_STRONG_ISS defines the mechanism used for TCP initial sequence number generation. If an attacker can predict the next sequence number, it is possible to inject fraudulent packets into the data stream to hijack the session."
    rationale: "The RFC 1948 method is widely accepted as the strongest mechanism for TCP packet generation. This makes remote session hijacking attacks more difficult, as well as any other network-based attack that relies on predicting TCP sequence number information. It is theoretically possible that there may be a small performance hit in connection setup time when this setting is used, but there are no publicly available benchmarks that establish this."

    title: "Enable Stack Protection."
    description: "Buffer overflow exploits have been the basis for many highly publicized compromises and defacements of large numbers of Internet connected systems. Many of the automated tools in use by system attackers exploit well-known buffer overflow problems in vendor-supplied and third party software."
    rationale: "Enabling stack protection prevents certain classes of buffer overflow attacks and is a significant security enhancement. However, this does not protect against buffer overflow attacks that do not execute code on the stack (such as return-to-libc exploits). While most of the Solaris OS is already configured to employ a non-executable stack, this setting is still recommended to provide a more comprehensive solution for both Solaris and other software that may be installed."

    description: "Solaris auditing service keeps a record of how a system is being used. Solaris auditing can be configured to record different classes of events based upon site policy. This recommendation will set and verify a consensus-developed auditing policy. That said, all organizations are encouraged to tailor this policy based upon their specific needs. For more information on the Solaris auditing service including how to filter and view events, see the Oracle Solaris product documentation. The cis class is a custom class that CIS recommends creating that includes specifically those events that are of interest (defined in the sections above). In addition to those events, this recommendation also includes auditing of login and logout (lo) events, administrative (ad) events, file transfer (ft) events, and command execution (ex) events. This recommendation also configures the Solaris auditing service to capture and report command line arguments (for command execution events) and the zone name in which a command was executed (for global and non-global zones). Further, this recommendation sets a disk utilization threshold of 1%. If this threshold is crossed (for the volume that includes /var/shares/audit), then a warning e-mail will be sent to advise the system administrators that audit events may be lost if the disk becomes full. Finally, this recommendation will also ensure that new audit trails are created at the start of each new day (to help keep the size of the files small to facilitate analysis)."

    rationale: "The flexibility that GRUB provides creates a security risk if its configuration is modified by an unauthorized user. The failsafe menu entry needs to be secured in the same environments that require securing the systems firmware to avoid unauthorized removable media boots. Setting the GRUB Menu password helps prevent attackers with physical access to the system console from booting off some external device (such as a CD-ROM or floppy) and subverting the security of the system.

When LOCK_AFTER_RETRIES is set in /etc/security/policy.conf, then the user's account is locked after this many failed retries (the account can only be unlocked by the administrator using the command: passwd -u <username>. The account lockout threshold (RETRIES parameter) restricts the number of failed login attempts allowed before requiring the offending account be locked. The lockout requirement will help block malicious users from gaining access to the host via automated, repetitive brute-force login exploits--trying different passwords until one fits a user name."
    rationale: "Setting the failed login limit to an appropriate value locks the user account, which will severely limit the speed of such attacks, making it much more likely that the attacker's pattern will be noticed and the offending source address and/or port blocked, so this should be set according to the needs of the user."
    remediation: "Perform the following to implement the recommended state: edit /etc/default/login - RETRIES=3, edit /etc/security/policy.conf - LOCK_AFTER_RETRIES=YES.

    description: "The characteristics of an operating system that make 'user identification' via password a secure and workable solution is the combination of settings chosen. By requiring that a series of password-choices be security-centric, it reduces the risk of a malicious user breaking the password through dictionary/brute force attacks or fortuitous guessing based upon 'social engineering.' A basic password security strategy is requiring a new password to be chosen every 45-90 days, so that repeated attempts to gain entry by brute-force tactics will fail when a new password is chosen, which requires starting over again to break the new password"
    rationale: "The commands for this item set all active accounts (except the root account) to force password changes every 91 days (13 weeks), and then prevent password changes for seven days (one week), thereafter.

    title: "Find Un-owned Files and Directories."
    description: "Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they neglect to remove all files owned by those users from the system."
    rationale: "A new user who is assigned the deleted user's user ID or group ID may then end up owning these files, and thus have more access on the system than was intended."
    remediation: "Correct or justify any items discovered in the Audit step. Determine the existence of any files that are not attributed to current users or groups on the system, and determine the best course of action in accordance with site policy. Note that the Solaris OS is shipped with all files appropriately owned."

    title: "Find Files and Directories with Extended Attributes."
    description: "Extended attributes are implemented as files in a shadow file system that is not generally visible via normal administration commands without special arguments."
    rationale: "Attackers or malicious users could hide information, exploits, etc. in extended attribute areas. Since extended attributes are rarely used, it is important to find files with extended attributes set."
    remediation: "Correct or justify any items discovered in the Audit step. Determine the existence of any files having extended file attributes, and determine the best course of action in accordance with site policy. Note that the Solaris OS does not ship with files that have extended attributes."
