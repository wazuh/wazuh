  description: "This document, CIS Oracle Solaris 11 Benchmark v1.1.0, provides prescriptive guidance for establishing a secure configuration posture for Oracle Solaris 11 on both x86 and SPARC platforms. This guide was tested against  Solaris 11 11/11 release, updated to the Software Repository Update 5 (SRU5). As of the publication of this document, Solaris 11 11/11 SRU5 is the latest available support update for the Solaris 11 OS. The recommendations included in this document may need to be adjusted for future Solaris 11 updates."

  # 2 Disable Unnecessary Services
  - id: 8000
    title: "Disable Local-only Graphical Login Environment"
    description: "The graphical login service provides the capability of logging into the system using an X- windows type interface from the console. If graphical login access for the console is required, leave the service in local-only mode."
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    title: "Configure sendmail Service for Local-Only Mode"
    description: "In Solaris 11, the sendmail service is set to local only mode by default. This means that users on remote systems cannot connect to the sendmail service, eliminating the possibility of a remote exploit attack against some future sendmail vulnerability. Leaving sendmail in local-only mode permits mail to be sent out from the local system. If the local system will not be processing or sending any mail, this service can be disabled. However, if sendmail is disabled completely, email messages sent to the root account (such as cron job output or audit service warnings) will fail to be delivered. An alternative approach is to disable the sendmail service and create a cron job to process all mail that is queued on the local system, sending it to a relay host defined in the sendmail.cf file. It is recommended that sendmail be left in local-only mode unless there is a specific requirement to completely disable it."
    rationale: "The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems."
    remediation: "Run the following to set sendmail to listen only local interfaces: # svccfg -v -s svc:/network/smtp:sendmail setprop config/local_only=false    # svcadm refresh sendmail    # svcadm restart sendmail"

    title: "Disable RPC Encryption Key"
    description: 'The keyserv service is only required for sites that are using the Secure RPC mechanism. The most common use for Secure RPC on Solaris machines is "secure NFS", which uses the Secure RPC mechanism to provide higher levels of security than the standard NFS protocols. ("Secure NFS" is unrelated to Kerberos authentication as a mechanism for providing higher levels of NFS security. "Kerberized" NFS does not require the keyserv service to be running.)'
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    description: "The NIS server software is not installed by default and is only required on systems that are acting as an NIS server for the local site. Typically there are only a small number of NIS servers on any given network. These services are disabled by default unless the system has been previously configured to act as a NIS server."
    rationale: "As RPC-based services such as NIS may use non-secure authentication and share sensitive network object information with systems and applications using RPC-based services, this service should be disabled. Users are encouraged to use LDAP as a name service in place of NIS."

    description: "If the local site is not using the NIS naming service to distribute system and user configuration information, this service may be disabled. This service is disabled by default unless the NIS service has been installed and configured on the system."
    rationale: "As RPC-based services such as NIS may use non-secure authentication and share sensitive network object information with systems and applications using RPC-based service, NIS client daemons should be disabled. Users are encouraged to use LDAP as a name service in place of NIS."
    remediation: "To disable this service, run the following commands: # svcadm disable svc:/network/nis/client    # svcadm disable svc:/network/nis/domain"

    description: 'The Kerberos TGT warning service is used to warn users when their Kerberos tickets are about expire or to renew those tickets before they expire. This service is not used if Kerberos has not been configured. This service is configured to be "local only" by default.'
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    description: "The GSS API is a security abstraction layer that is designed to make it easier for developers to integrate with different authentication schemes. It is most commonly used in applications for sites that use Kerberos for network authentication, though it can also allow applications to interoperate with other authentication schemes."
    rationale: "GSS does not expose anything external to the system as it is configured to use TLI (protocol = ticotsord) by default. This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    title: "Disable Removable Volume Manager"
    description: "The HAL-aware removable volume manager in the Solaris 11 OS automatically mounts external devices for users whenever the device is attached to the system. These devices include CD-R, CD-RW, floppies, DVD, USB and 1394 mass storage devices. See the rmvolmgr(1M) manual page for more details."
    rationale: "Allowing users to mount and access data from removable media devices makes it easier for malicious programs and data to be imported onto the network. It also introduces the risk that sensitive data may be transferred off the system without a log record. By adding rmvolmgr to the .xinitrc file, user-isolated instances of rmvolmgr can be run via a session startup script. In such cases, the rmvolmgr instance will not allow management of volumes that belong to other than the owner of the startup script. When a user logs onto the workstation console (/dev/console), any instance of user-initiated rmvolmgr will only own locally connected devices, such as CD-ROMs or flash memory hardware, locally connected to USB or FireWire ports."

    title: "Disable automount Service"
    description: "The automount daemon is normally used to automatically mount NFS file systems from remote file servers when needed. However, the automount daemon can also be configured to mount local (loopback) file systems as well, which may include local user home directories, depending on the system configuration."
    rationale: "This service should be disabled if it is not required."

    title: "Disable Local-only RPC Port Mapping Service"
    description: "Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is used by many services within the Solaris 11 operating system. Some of these services allow external connections to use the service (e.g. NFS, NIS). By default, the Solaris 11 OS configures this service to be local only."
    rationale: "RPC-based services typically have weak or non-existent authentication and yet may share very sensitive information, which is vulnerable to network traffic sniffers. Unless one of these services is required on this host, RPC-based tools should be fully disabled."
    remediation: "To disable this service, run the following command: # svcadm disable svc:/network/rpc/bind. If the goal is to restrict access to this service, but not disable it completely, consider using a host-based firewall such as ipfilter(5) to control what hosts are allowed to access this service. Alternatively, TCP Wrappers support, which controls host access and connection auditing, can be enabled. TCP Wrappers is discussed in the next section."
    compliance:

    condition: all
    rules:
      - 'c:svcs -xv svc:/network/rpc/bind -> r:State:\sdisabled|State:\s-$|match\sany\sinstances'

  - id: 8011
    title: "Configure TCP Wrappers"
    description: "TCP Wrappers is a host-based access control system that allows administrators to control who has access to various network services based on the IP address of the remote end of the connection. TCP Wrappers also provide logging information via syslog about both successful and unsuccessful connections."
    rationale: "TCP Wrappers provides granular control over what services can be accessed over the network. Its logs show attempted access to services from non-authorized systems, which can help identify unauthorized access attempts."
    remediation: 'To enable TCP Wrappers, run the following commands: 1. Create and customize your policy in /etc/hosts.allow: # echo "ALL: <net>/<mask>, <net/<mask>, ..." > /etc/hosts.allow. Where each <net>/<mask> combination (for example, the Class C address block "192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0") can represent one network block in use by your organization that requires access to this system. 2) Create a default deny policy in /etc/hosts.deny: # echo "ALL: ALL" >/etc/hosts.deny. 3) Enable TCP Wrappers for all services started by inetd: # inetadm -M tcp_wrappers=TRUE - To protect only specific inetd services, use the command: # inetadm -m [FMRI] tcp_wrappers=TRUE. To enable TCP Wrappers for the RPC port mapping service, use the commands: # svccfg -s rpc/bind setprop config/enable_tcpwrappers=true    # svcadm refresh rpc/bind. The versions of SSH and sendmail that ship with Solaris 11 will automatically use TCP Wrappers to filter access if a hosts.allow or hosts.deny file exists. To protect UDP and RPC-based services that are spawned from inetd, consider implementing a host-based firewall such as Solaris IP Filter. See ipfilter(5) for more information.'

    title: "Disable Telnet Service"
    description: "The telnet daemon, which accepts connections from users from other systems via the telnet protocol and can be used for remote shell access."
    rationale: "The telnet protocol is insecure and unencrypted. The use of an unencrypted transmission medium could allow a user with access to sniff network traffic the ability to steal credentials. The ssh protocol provides an encrypted session and stronger security."

    title: "Enable Stack Protection"
    description: "Buffer overflow exploits have been the basis for many highly publicized compromises and defacements of large numbers of Internet connected systems. Many of the automated tools in use by system attackers exploit well-known buffer overflow problems in vendor- supplied and third party software."
    rationale: "Enabling stack protection prevents certain classes of buffer overflow attacks and is a significant security enhancement. However, this does not protect against buffer overflow attacks that do not execute code on the stack (such as return-to-libc exploits). While most of the Solaris OS is already configured to employ a non-executable stack, this setting is still recommended to provide a more comprehensive solution for both Solaris and other software that may be installed."
    remediation: 'To enable stack protection and block stack-smashing attacks, run the following to edit the /etc/system file: # if [ ! "`grep noexec_user_stack= /etc/system`" ]; then cat <<END_CFG >>/etc/system set noexec_user_stack=1 set noexec_user_stack_log=1 END_CFG fi'

    title: "Enable Strong TCP Sequence Number Generation"
    description: "The variable TCP_STRONG_ISS defines the mechanism used for TCP initial sequence number generation. If an attacker can predict the next sequence number, it is possible to inject fraudulent packets into the data stream to hijack the session."
    rationale: "The RFC 1948 method is widely accepted as the strongest mechanism for TCP packet generation. This makes remote session hijacking attacks more difficult, as well as any other network-based attack that relies on predicting TCP sequence number information. It is theoretically possible that there may be a small performance hit in connection setup time when this setting is used, but there are no publicly available benchmarks that establish this."
    remediation: 'Run the following commands to set the TCP_STRONG_ISS parameter to use RFC 1948 sequence number generation in the /etc/default/inetinit file: # cd /etc/default    # awk ''/TCP_STRONG_ISS=/ { $1 = "TCP_STRONG_ISS=2" }; { print }'' inetinit > inetinit.CIS    # mv inetinit.CIS inetinit     To set the TCP_STRONG_ISS parameter on a running system, use the command: # ipadm set-prop -p _strong_iss=2 tcp'

    title: "Configure Solaris Auditing"
    description: 'Solaris auditing service keeps a record of how a system is being used. Solaris auditing can be configured to record different classes of events based upon site policy. This recommendation will set and verify a consensus-developed auditing policy. That said, all organizations are encouraged to tailor this policy based upon their specific needs. For more information on the Solaris auditing service including how to filter and view events, see the Oracle Solaris product documentation. The "cis" class is a "custom class" that CIS recommends creating that includes specifically those events that are of interest (defined in the sections above). In addition to those events, this recommendation also includes auditing of login and logout (lo) events, administrative (ad) events, file transfer (ft) events, and command execution (ex) events. This recommendation also configures the Solaris auditing service to capture and report command line arguments (for command execution events) and the zone name in which a command was executed (for global and non-global zones). Further, this recommendation sets a disk utilization threshold of 1%. If this threshold is crossed (for the volume that includes /var/audit), then a warning e-mail will be sent to advise the system administrators that audit events may be lost if the disk becomes full. Finally, this recommendation will also ensure that new audit trails are created at the start of each new day (to help keep the size of the files small to facilitate analysis).'
    rationale: "The consensus settings described in this section are an effort to log interesting system events without consuming excessive amounts of resources logging significant but usually uninteresting system calls."
