  - id: 40408
    title: Ensure mounting of pseudofs filesystems is disabled.
    description: >
      The pseudofs module offers an abstract API for pseudo-file systems such
      as procfs(5) and linprocfs(5).  It takes care of all the hairy bits like
      interfacing with the VFS system, enforcing access control, keeping track
      of file numbers, and cloning files and directories that are process-
      specific.  The consumer module, i.e., the module that implements the
      actual guts of the file system, needs only provide the directory
      structure (represented by a collection of structures declared and
      initialized by macros provided by pseudofs) and callbacks that report
      file attributes or write the actual file contents into sbufs.

  # 1.1.2 Configure /tmp
  ###############################################
  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition. (Automated)
  - id: 40409
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab: Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate: Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nosuid,noexec 0 0"

      SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that
      encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet
      was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake

    rationale: >
      Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by

    title: "Ensure Packet Filter is installed."
    description: "FreeBSD has three firewalls built into the base system: PF, IPFW, and IPFILTER, also known as IPF. FreeBSD also provides two traffic shapers for controlling bandwidth usage: altq(4) and dummynet(4). ALTQ has traditionally been closely tied with PF and dummynet with IPFW. Each firewall uses rules to control the access of packets to and from a FreeBSD system, although they go about it in different ways and each has a different rule syntax."
    rationale: "A firewall utility is required to configure the FreeBSD kernel's filter framework.

  # 4.2.5 Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate. (Automated)
  - id: 40505
    title: "Ensure SSH LogLevel is appropriate."
    description: "INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments."

    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option enabled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks.

    description: "Local accounts can uses encrypted passwords. With encrypted passwords, The passwords are saved in /etc/master.passwd file encrypted by crypt. Accounts with a encrypted password have an * in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using encrypted passwords. The /etc/master.passwd file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack."
    remediation: "Run the following command to set accounts to use encrypted passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:*:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."
