  # 2.1 Minimize NGINX Modules

  # 2.1.1 Ensure only required modules are installed (Not Scored)
  # Not automatable

  # 2.1.2 Ensure HTTP WebDAV module is not installed (Scored)
  - id: 23000
    title: "Ensure HTTP WebDAV module is not installed"
    description: "The http_dav_module enables HTTP Extensions for Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) as defined by RFC 4918. This enables file-based operations on your web server, such as the ability to create, delete, change and move files on your server. Most modern architectures have replaced this functionality with cloud-based object storage, in which case the module should not be installed."
    rationale: "WebDAV functionality opens up an unnecessary path for exploiting your web server. Through misconfigurations of WebDAV operations, an attacker may be able to access and manipulate files on the server."
    remediation: "To remove the http_dav_module, recompile nginx from source without the --withhttp_dav_module flag."

  - id: 23001
    title: "Ensure modules with gzip functionality are disabled"
    description: "gzip is used for compression. Compression functionality should be disabled to prevent certain types of attacks from being performed successfully."
    rationale: "Compression has been linked with the Breach attack and others. While the Breach attack has been mitigated with modern usages of the HTTP protocol, disabling the use of compression is considered a defense-in-depth strategy to mitigate other attacks."
    remediation: "In order to disable the http_gzip_module, nginx must be recompiled from source. This can be accomplished using the below command in the folder you used during your original compilation. This must be done without the --with-http_gzip_static_module configuration directive.

  - id: 23002
    title: "Ensure the autoindex module is disabled"
    description: "The autoindex module processes requests ending with the slash character. This feature enables directory listing, which could be useful in attacker reconnaissance, so it should be disabled."
    rationale: "Automated directory listings may reveal information helpful to an attacker, such as naming conventions and directory paths. Directory listings may also reveal files that were not intended to be revealed."
    remediation: "Perform the following to disable the autoindex module: 1. Search the NGINX configuration files (nginx.conf and any included configuration files) to find autoindex directives. 'egrep -i '^\\s*autoindex\\s+' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf'. 'egrep -i '^\\s*autoindex\\s+' /etc/nginx/conf.d/*'. 2. Set the value for all autoindex directives to off, or remove those directives."

  # 2.2 Account Security

  # 2.2.1 Ensure that NGINX is run using a non-privileged, dedicated service account (Not Scored)
  - id: 23003
    title: "Ensure that NGINX is run using a non-privileged, dedicated service account"
    description: "The nginx user directive designates which user account nginx worker processes run under. Ensuring a non-privileged, dedicated service account is used is a defense in depth measure to limit what an attacker who compromises the account can do."
    rationale: "Running a web server under a non-privileged, dedicated service account helps mitigate the risk of lateral movement to other services or processes in the event the user account running the web services is compromised. The default user nobody is typically used for several processes, and if this is compromised, it could allow an attacker to have access to all processes running as that user."
    remediation: "Add a system account for the nginx user with a home directory of /var/cache/nginx and a shell of /sbin/nologin so it does not have the ability to log in, then add the nginx user to be used by nginx: 'user add nginx -r -g nginx -d /var/cache/nginx -s /sbin/nologin'.

    description: "The nginx user account should have a valid password, but the account should be locked. NOTE: If a different account is used to run nginx, that account's name should be substituted for nginx in the audit and remediation procedures."
    rationale: "As a defense-in-depth measure, the nginx user account should be locked to prevent logins and to prevent someone from switching users to nginx using the password. In general, there shouldn't be a need for anyone to have to su as nginx, and when there is a need, sudo should be used instead, which would not require the nginx account password."

    title: "Ensure the NGINX service account has an invalid shell"
    description: "The nginx account should not have the ability to log in, so the /sbin/nologin shell should be set for the account."
    rationale: "The account used for nginx should only be used for the nginx service and does not need to have the ability to log in. This prevents an attacker who compromises the account to log in with it."

    title: "Ensure NGINX directories and files are owned by root"
    description: "The owner and group of the /etc/nginx directory and its files should be root."
    rationale: "Setting ownership to only those users in the root group and the root user will reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications to the nginx configuration files."

    title: "Ensure the NGINX process ID (PID) file is secured"
    description: "The PID file stores the main process ID of the nginx process. This file should be protected from unauthorized modification."
    rationale: "The PID file should be owned by root and the group root. It should also be readable to everyone, but only writable by root (permissions 644). This will prevent unauthorized modification of the PID file, which could cause a denial of service."
    remediation: "If the PID file is not owned by root, issue this command: 'chown root:root /var/run/nginx.pid'. If the PID file has permissions greater than 644, issue this command: 'chown 644 /var/run/nginx.pid'"

  # 2.3.4 Ensure the core dump directory is secured (Not Scored)
  - id: 23009
    title: "Ensure the core dump directory is secured"
    description: "Core dumps are snapshots of memory. The working_directorydirective is used to specify the directory NGINX attempts to create core dumps in. Core dumps will be disabled if the directory is not writable by the NGINX user. It is recommended that the working_directory directive be set to a directory that is owned by the root user and the group the NGINX process executes as, and is inaccessible to other users. Usually, production systems should not have this enabled."
    rationale: "Core dumps may contain sensitive information that should not be accessible by other accounts on the system."
    remediation: "Either remove the working_directory directive from the NGINX configuration files or ensure that the configured directory meets the following requirements: 1. It is not within the NGINX web document root. 2. It is owned by root and has a group ownership of the NGINX group: 'chown root:nginx /var/log/nginx'. 3.

    title: "Ensure NGINX only listens for network connections on authorized ports"
    description: "NGINX can be configured to listen on any port, but it should be configured to listen on authorized ports only."
    rationale: "Limiting the listening ports to only those that are authorized helps to ensure no unauthorized services are running through the use of nginx."

  - id: 23011
    title: "Ensure keepalive_timeout is 10 seconds or less, but not 0"
    description: "Persistent connections are leveraged by all modern browsers to facilitate greater web performance. The keep-alive timeout limits the time a persistent connection may remain open. Setting the keep-alive timeout allows this timeout to be controlled on the server side."
    rationale: "Setting a keep-alive timeout on the server side helps mitigate denial of service attacks that establish too many persistent connections, exhausting server resources."
    remediation: "Find the HTTP or server block of your nginx configuration, and add the keepalive_timeout directive. Set it to 10 seconds or less, but not 0. This example command sets it to 10 seconds: 'keepalive_timeout 10;'"

    description: "The send_timeout directive sets a timeout for transmitting a response to the client between two successive write operations."
    rationale: "Setting the send_timeout directive on the server side helps mitigate slow HTTP denial of service attacks by ensuring write operations taking up large amounts of time are closed."

Optionally, this parameter may be changed to 4096 for greater security. It will also output your certificate signing request to the nginx.csr file in your present working directory. Step 2: Obtain a signed certificate from your certificate authority. Provide your chosen certificate authority with your certificate signing request. Follow your certificate authority's signing procedures in order to obtain a certificate and the certificate's trust chain. A full trust chain is typically delivered in .pem format. Step 3: Install certificate and signing certificate chain on your web server. Place the .pem file from your certificate authority into the directory of your choice. Locate your created key file from the command you used to generate your certificate signing request. Open your website configuration file and edit your encrypted listener to leverage the ssl_certificate and ssl_certificate_key directives for a web server as shown below.

    rationale: "Why disable SSL 3.0: The POODLE Vulnerability allowed attackers to exploit SSL 3.0 to obtain cleartext information by exploiting weaknesses in CBC in 2014. SSL 3.0 is also no longer FIPS 140-2 compliant. Why disable TLS 1.0: TLS 1.0 was deprecated from use when PCI DSS Compliance mandated that it not be used for any applications processing credit card numbers in June 2018. TLS 1.0 does not make use of modern protections, and almost all user agents that do not support TLS 1.2 or higher are no longer supported by their vendor. Why disable TLS 1.1: Because of the increased security associated with higher versions of TLS, TLS 1.0 should be disabled. Modern browsers will begin to flag TLS 1.1 as deprecated in early 2019.

Weak ciphers should be disabled based on your company's policy or an industry best practice compliance profile. The ssl_prefer_server_ciphers should be used to ensure the user agent respects the server's preferred cipher order and does not set its own. If you are using a proxy or load balancer, you should use the proxy_ssl_ciphers directive to ensure your upstream connections are negotiated using secure ciphers."
    rationale: "The use of strong ciphers is critical to maintaining strong encryption on your web server, load balancer, or proxy. Weak ciphers may compromise the security of your site or your users by allowing legacy user agents to connect to your site in a vulnerable way. You may also meet compliance concerns by ensuring that your upstream connections meet the same level of security if using a proxy or load balancer. The server should enforce the cipher preference on the server side to protect users from malicious actors on the client side."

    description: "OCSP allows a user's browser or another user agent to verify the certificate it is seeing is not revoked. OCSP stapling ensures your server presents this information to the user's browser in a way that best meets the performance and security needs of your website. It polls the Certificate Authority's (CA) OCSP server at regular intervals to ensure it is continuously kept up to date. OCSP stapling helps improve performance and security, so it should be enabled."
    rationale: "OCSP stapling protects your users from accessing a website where a private key is believed to be compromised. If a private key is compromised, an attacker may be able to obtain unauthorized access to the encrypted data transmitted by a user. Note: OCSP stapling, while a step forward from the older certificate revocation list model, does share similar risks. Between the time a certificate is revoked and the point where a new signed OCSP profile is requested, if a server's certificate has been revoked a user agent may not be informed."
    remediation: 'Follow this procedure to enable OCSP validation. Step 1: Ensure your NGINX server has access to your CA''s OCSP server. Your CA''s OCSP server may be found on your CA''s website and will vary depending on your CA vendor. Issue the following command in order to check your connectivity to their site. ''curl -I "insert certificate authority ocsp server here"''. If you get a 200 code response, your server has access. Step 2. Enable OCSP on nginx. Implement the ssl_stapling and ssl_stapling_verify directives.

  # 5.1.1 Ensure allow and deny filters limit access to specific IP addresses (Not Scored)
  - id: 23037
    title: "Ensure allow and deny filters limit access to specific IP addresses"
    description: "IP-based restrictions act as a defense in depth mechanism. They allow you to whitelist legitimate paths to your applications and explicitly deny IP addresses you believe to be malicious."
    rationale: "IP restrictions help you to only allow traffic based on the concept of least privilege. You may specify vlans, countries, or specific servers that may be allowed or denied on your site. It is recommended that you implicitly deny all traffic and only allow those with a legitimate use case to access your website if choosing to take this approach. This allows you to limit the surface area an attack may come from."
    remediation: "Compile a list of network ranges or IP addresses you would want to access your web server or proxy. Then add these ranges with the allow directive. The deny directive should be included with all IP addresses implicitly denied. 'location / {allow 10.1.1.1;deny all;}'"

  # 5.2.1 Ensure timeout values for reading the client header and body are set correctly (Scored)
  - id: 23038
    title: "Ensure timeout values for reading the client header and body are set correctly"
    description: "The client_header_timeout and client_body_timeout directives define the time the server will wait for the header or body to be sent from the client. If the client does not send the entire header in this predefined timeframe, the server will send back a 408 request timeout error."
    rationale: "Setting the client header and body timeouts help your server mitigate possible denial of service attacks. By timing out a request, the server is able to free up resources that may be waiting for the body or header."
    remediation: "Find the HTTP or server block of your nginx configuration and add the client_header_timeout and client_body_timeout directives set to the configuration. The below example sets the timeouts to 10 seconds. 'client_body_timeout 10; client_header_timeout 10;'"

  # 5.2.2 Ensure the maximum request body size is set correctly (Scored)

    title: "Ensure the maximum request body size is set correctly"
    description: "The client_max_body_size directive sets the size of the request body that is allowed to read a client request. This defines the number of bytes allowed in a request and is equivalent to the Content-Length request header field."
    rationale: "Limiting the size of the request body helps prevent unexpectedly long or large client requests from being passed to an application to perform buffer overflow attacks. This value should be set low enough to protect the application but high enough not to interfere with functionality and block legitimate request bodies."
    remediation: "Find the HTTP or server block of your nginx configuration and add the client_max_body_size set to 100K in this block. The appropriate value may be different based on your application's needs. 'client_max_body_size 100K'"

    title: "Ensure the maximum buffer size for URIs is defined"
    description: "The large_client_header_buffers directive defines the number and size of buffers used within the URI. A request cannot exceed the size of this buffer when this directive is configured. The large_client_header_buffers directive should be set to restrict buffer usage. The number of buffers should generally set to two and the length be set to 1K; however, this may not be a good fit for your application and may need to be set differently."
    rationale: "The large_client_header_buffers directive may assist in preventing buffer overflow attacks that leverage long URI query parameters."
    remediation: "Open your nginx.conf file and locate your server or HTTP blocks. This may be added to the HTTP block for all configurations or the server block for more specific configurations to meet your needs.

    description: "The maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed from a single IP address to your server should be limited. It should be set to a value that meets your organizational policies."
    rationale: "Limiting the number of simultaneous connections is an effective way to prevent slow denial of service attacks that try to use as many server resources as possible. This can also help prevent brute force attacks on a login page."
    remediation: "Implement the below directives under the HTTP and server blocks of your nginx configuration or any include files. The below configuration creates a memory zone of 10 megabytes called limitperip. It will limit the number of connections per IP address to 10 simultaneous connections.
