  - id: 3500
    title: "Create Separate Partition for /tmp"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code."
    remediation: "For new installations, check the box to 'Review and modify partitioning' and create a separate partition for /tmp . For systems that were previously installed, use the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) to create partitions."

It also allows /var/tmp to inherit the same mount options that /tmp owns, allowing /var/tmp to be protected in the same /tmp is protected."
    rationale: "All programs that use /var/tmp and /tmp to read/write temporary files will always be written to the /tmp file system, preventing a user from running the /var file system out of space or trying to perform operations that have been blocked in the /tmp filesystem."

    rationale: "Some routers (and some attackers) will send responses that violate RFC-1122 and attempt to fill up a log file system with many useless error messages."

    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a server by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding."
