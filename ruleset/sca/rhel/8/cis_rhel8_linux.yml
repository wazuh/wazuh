  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition. (Automated)
  - id: 5003
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment. <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers.

    title: "Ensure bootloader password is set."
    description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters."
    rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off SELinux at boot time)."
    impact: 'If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing "e" or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing "c" If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items.'
    remediation: "Create an encrypted password with grub2-setpassword: # grub2-setpassword Enter password: <password> Confirm password: <password> Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration: # grub2-mkconfig -o \"$(dirname \"$(find /boot -type f \\( -name 'grubenv' -o - name 'grub.conf' -o -name 'grub.cfg' \\) -exec grep -Pl '^\\h*(kernelopts=|linux|kernel)' {} \\;)\")/grub.cfg\"."

    description: "The grub files contain information on boot settings and passwords for unlocking boot options. The grub2 configuration is usually grub.cfg.

The vfat filesystem itself doesn't have the concept of permissions but can be mounted under Linux with whatever permissions desired."
    rationale: "Setting the permissions to read and write for root only prevents non-root users from seeing the boot parameters or changing them. Non-root users who read the boot parameters may be able to identify weaknesses in security upon boot and be able to exploit them."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to set ownership and permissions on your grub configuration file(s): # [ -f /boot/grub2/grub.cfg ] && chown root:root /boot/grub2/grub.cfg # [ -f /boot/grub2/grub.cfg ] && chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grub.cfg # [ -f /boot/grub2/grubenv ] && chown root:root /boot/grub2/grubenv # [ -f /boot/grub2/grubenv ] && chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/grubenv # [ -f /boot/grub2/user.cfg ] && chown root:root /boot/grub2/user.cfg # [ -f /boot/grub2/user.cfg ] && chmod og-rwx /boot/grub2/user.cfg OR If the system uses UEFI, edit /etc/fstab and add the fmask=0077, uid=0, and gid=0 options: Example: <device> /boot/efi vfat defaults,umask=0027,fmask=0077,uid=0,gid=0 0 0 Note: This may require a re-boot to enable the change."

    title: "Ensure system-wide crypto policy is not legacy."
    description: "The system-wide crypto-policies followed by the crypto core components allow consistently deprecating and disabling algorithms system-wide. The individual policy levels (DEFAULT, LEGACY, FUTURE, and FIPS) are included in the crypto-policies(7) package."
    rationale: "If the Legacy system-wide crypto policy is selected, it includes support for TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and SSH2 protocols or later. The algorithms DSA, 3DES, and RC4 are allowed, while RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if larger than 1023-bits. These legacy protocols and algorithms can make the system vulnerable to attacks, including those listed in RFC 7457."
    impact: "Environments that require compatibility with older insecure protocols may require the use of the less secure LEGACY policy level."
    remediation: "Run the following command to change the system-wide crypto policy # update-crypto-policies --set <CRYPTO POLICY> Example: # update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT Run the following to make the updated system-wide crypto policy active # update-crypto-policies."

    description: 'Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. "SNMPv2 historic" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system.'
    rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: - The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values. -."

Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."

Use the firewalld utility to configure a firewall for less complex firewalls. The utility is easy to use and covers the typical use cases scenario. FirewallD supports both IPv4 and IPv6 networks and can administer separate firewall zones with varying degrees of trust as defined in zone profiles.

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non-privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

  # 5.2.19 Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less. (Automated)
  - id: 5182
    title: "Ensure SSH LoginGraceTime is set to one minute or less."
    description: "The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access."
    rationale: "Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: LoginGraceTime 60."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 5183
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. - ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk. - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is no greater than 900 seconds (15 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 0 - At the 15 minute interval, if the ssh session is inactive, the session will be terminated."
    impact: "In some cases this setting may cause termination of long-running scripts over SSH or remote automation tools which rely on SSH. In developing the local site policy, the requirements of such scripts should be considered and appropriate ServerAliveInterval and ClientAliveInterval settings should be calculated to insure operational continuity."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. This should include ClientAliveInterval between 1 and 900 and ClientAliveCountMax of 0: ClientAliveInterval 900 ClientAliveCountMax 0."

    title: "Ensure default user umask is 027 or more restrictive."
    description: "The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is use to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either octal or Symbolic values: - Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask can be set to use the pam_umask module or in a System Wide Shell Configuration File. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default umask by adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, (.bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory. Setting the default umask: - pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the <primary group name> userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user - System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter. o /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables. o /etc/bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. In Fedora derived distributions, etc/bashrc also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to /etc/bashrc. User Shell Configuration Files: - ~/.bash_profile - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. Is only read by login shells. - ~/.bashrc - Is executed for interactive shells. only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login."
    rationale: "Setting a secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A permissive umask value could result in directories or files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users."
    remediation: "Review /etc/bashrc, /etc/profile, and all files ending in *.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory and remove or edit all umask entries to follow local site policy. Any remaining entries should be: umask 027, umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= or more restrictive. Configure umask in one of the following files: - A file in the /etc/profile.d/ directory ending in .sh - /etc/profile - /etc/bashrc Example: # vi /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh umask 027 Run the following command and remove or modify the umask of any returned files: # grep -RPi '(^|^[^#]*)\\s*umask\\s+([0-7][0-7][01][0-7]\\b|[0-7][0-7][0-7][0- 6]\\b|[0-7][01][0-7]\\b|[0-7][0-7][0- 6]\\b|(u=[rwx]{0,3},)?(g=[rwx]{0,3},)?o=[rwx]+\\b|(u=[rwx]{1,3},)?g=[^rx]{1,3}( ,o=[rwx]{0,3})?\\b)' /etc/login.defs /etc/profile* /etc/bashrc* Follow one of the following methods to set the default user umask: Edit /etc/login.defs and edit the UMASK and USERGROUPS_ENAB lines as follows: UMASK 027 USERGROUPS_ENAB no Edit the files /etc/pam.d/password-auth and /etc/pam.d/system-auth and add or edit the following: session optional pam_umask.so OR Configure umask in one of the following files: - A file in the /etc/profile.d/ directory ending in .sh - /etc/profile - /etc/bashrc Example: /etc/profile.d/set_umask.sh umask 027 Note: this method only applies to bash and shell. If other shells are supported on the system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are checked."

    remediation: "Remove any users other than root with UID 0 or assign them a new UID if appropriate."
