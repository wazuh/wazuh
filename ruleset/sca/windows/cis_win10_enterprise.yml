  # 1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)'. (Automated)
   - id: 15500
     title: "Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)'."
     description: "This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand-alone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s). Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center. Note #2: As of the publication of this benchmark, Microsoft currently has a maximum limit of 24 saved passwords. For more information, please visit Enforce password history (Windows 10) - Windows security | Microsoft Docs."
     rationale: "The longer a user uses the same password, the greater the chance that an attacker can determine the password through brute force attacks. Also, any accounts that may have been compromised will remain exploitable for as long as the password is left unchanged. If password changes are required but password reuse is not prevented, or if users continually reuse a small number of passwords, the effectiveness of a good password policy is greatly reduced. If you specify a low number for this policy setting, users will be able to use the same small number of passwords repeatedly. If you do not also configure the Minimum password age setting, users might repeatedly change their passwords until they can reuse their original password."
     impact: "The major impact of this configuration is that users must create a new password every time they are required to change their old one. If users are required to change their passwords to new unique values, there is an increased risk of users who write their passwords somewhere so that they do not forget them. Another risk is that users may create passwords that change incrementally (for example, password01, password02, and so on) to facilitate memorization but make them easier to guess. Also, an excessively low value for the Minimum password age setting will likely increase administrative overhead, because users who forget their passwords might ask the help desk to reset them frequently."

  # 1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0'. (Automated)
   - id: 15501
     title: "Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0'."
     description: "This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0. Note: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center."
     rationale: "The longer a password exists the higher the likelihood that it will be compromised by a brute force attack, by an attacker gaining general knowledge about the user, or by the user sharing the password. Configuring the Maximum password age setting to 0 so that users are never required to change their passwords is a major security risk because that allows a compromised password to be used by the malicious user for as long as the valid user has authorized access."
     impact: "If the Maximum password age setting is too low, users are required to change their passwords very often. Such a configuration can reduce security in the organization, because users might write their passwords in an insecure location or lose them. If the value for this policy setting is too high, the level of security within an organization is reduced because it allows potential attackers more time in which to discover user passwords or to use compromised accounts."

   - id: 15502
     title: "Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)'."
     description: "This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days. The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s)).

However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center."
     rationale: "Users may have favorite passwords that they like to use because they are easy to remember and they believe that their password choice is secure from compromise. Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual's user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old passwords can cause a security breach. To address password reuse a combination of security settings is required. Using this policy setting with the Enforce password history setting prevents the easy reuse of old passwords. For example, if you configure the Enforce password history setting to ensure that users cannot reuse any of their last 12 passwords, they could change their password 13 times in a few minutes and reuse the password they started with, unless you also configure the Minimum password age setting to a number that is greater than 0. You must configure this policy setting to a number that is greater than 0 for the Enforce password history setting to be effective."
     impact: "If an administrator sets a password for a user but wants that user to change the password when the user first logs on, the administrator must select the User must change password at next logon check box, or the user will not be able to change the password until the next day."

  # 1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'. (Automated)
   - id: 15503
     title: "Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)'."
     description: "This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps \"passphrase\" is a better term than \"password.\" In Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer, passphrases can be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as \"I want to drink a $5 milkshake\" is a valid passphrase; it is a considerably stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially around password length. In enterprise environments, the ideal value for the Minimum password length setting is 14 characters, however you should adjust this value to meet your organization's business requirements. The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s). Note: In Windows Server 2016 and older versions of Windows Server, the GUI of the Local Security Policy (LSP), Local Group Policy Editor (LGPE) and Group Policy Management Editor (GPME) would not let you set this value higher than 14 characters. However, starting with Windows Server 2019, Microsoft changed the GUI to allow up to a 20 character minimum password length. Note #2: Password Policy settings (section 1.1) and Account Lockout Policy settings (section 1.2) must be applied via the Default Domain Policy GPO in order to be globally in effect on domain user accounts as their default behavior. If these settings are configured in another GPO, they will only affect local user accounts on the computers that receive the GPO. However, custom exceptions to the default password policy and account lockout policy rules for specific domain users and/or groups can be defined using Password Settings Objects (PSOs), which are completely separate from Group Policy and most easily configured using Active Directory Administrative Center."
     rationale: "Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks (which attempt to use common words and phrases) and brute force attacks (which try every possible combination of characters). Also, attackers sometimes try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."
     impact: "Requirements for extremely long passwords can actually decrease the security of an organization, because users might leave the information in an insecure location or lose it. If very long passwords are required, mistyped passwords could cause account lockouts and increase the volume of help desk calls. If your organization has issues with forgotten passwords due to password length requirements, consider teaching your users about passphrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger number of character combinations, much harder to discover. Note: Older versions of Windows such as Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating systems are unable to authenticate with computers or domains that use accounts that require long passwords."

If the value for this policy setting is configured to 0, locked out accounts will remain locked out until an administrator manually unlocks them. Although it might seem like a good idea to configure the value for this policy setting to a high value, such a configuration will likely increase the number of calls that the help desk receives to unlock accounts locked by mistake. Users should be aware of the length of time a lock remains in place, so that they realize they only need to call the help desk if they have an extremely urgent need to regain access to their computer.

     title: "Ensure 'Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts' is set to 'Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts'."
     description: "This policy setting prevents users from adding new Microsoft accounts on this computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts. Note: Due to the way Windows 10 version 1607 (and older) handles the process for adding Microsoft Accounts, this legacy setting will remain in the Windows 10 Benchmarks until extended support for LTSB 1607 ends in October of 2026. Applying this setting to newer versions of the OS will not cause an issue, and the OS will ignore the setting. For newer versions of the OS, this setting has been replaced with Block all consumer Microsoft account user authentication. For more information please visit: Accounts Block Microsoft accounts - Windows 10 | Microsoft Learn."
     rationale: "Organizations that want to effectively implement identity management policies and maintain firm control of what accounts are used to log onto their computers will probably want to block Microsoft accounts. Organizations may also need to block Microsoft accounts in order to meet the requirements of compliance standards that apply to their information systems."
     impact: "Users will not be able to log onto the computer with their Microsoft account."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Users can't add or log on with Microsoft accounts: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Accounts: Block Microsoft accounts."

     description: "This policy setting determines whether the Guest account is enabled or disabled. The Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to gain access to the system. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: This setting will have no impact when applied to the Domain Controllers organizational unit via group policy because Domain Controllers have no local account database. It can be configured at the domain level via group policy, similar to account lockout and password policy settings."
     rationale: "The default Guest account allows unauthenticated network users to log on as Guest with no password. These unauthorized users could access any resources that are accessible to the Guest account over the network. This capability means that any network shares with permissions that allow access to the Guest account, the Guests group, or the Everyone group will be accessible over the network, which could lead to the exposure or corruption of data."
     impact: "All network users will need to authenticate before they can access shared resources. If you disable the Guest account and the Network Access: Sharing and Security Model option is set to Guest Only, network logons, such as those performed by the Microsoft Network Server (SMB Service), will fail.

If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers.

     rationale: "Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domain-based password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on."

     description: "The built-in local administrator account is a well-known account name that attackers will target. It is recommended to choose another name for this account, and to avoid names that denote administrative or elevated access accounts. Be sure to also change the default description for the local administrator (through the Computer Management console)."
     rationale: "The Administrator account exists on all computers that run the Windows 2000 or newer operating systems. If you rename this account, it is slightly more difficult for unauthorized persons to guess this privileged user name and password combination. The built-in Administrator account cannot be locked out, regardless of how many times an attacker might use a bad password. This capability makes the Administrator account a popular target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. The value of this countermeasure is lessened because this account has a well-known SID, and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. Therefore, even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on."

     title: "Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled'."
     description: "This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. If the Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits setting is enabled, unplanned system failures can occur. The administrative burden can be significant, especially if you also configure the Retention method for the Security log to Do not overwrite events (clear log manually). This configuration causes a repudiation threat (a backup operator could deny that they backed up or restored data) to become a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability, because a server could be forced to shut down if it is overwhelmed with logon events and other security events that are written to the Security log. Also, because the shutdown is not graceful, it is possible that irreparable damage to the operating system, applications, or data could result. Although the NTFS file system guarantees its integrity when an ungraceful computer shutdown occurs, it cannot guarantee that every data file for every application will still be in a usable form when the computer restarts. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
     rationale: "If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident.

     rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations.

     title: "Ensure 'Domain member: Disable machine account password changes' is set to 'Disabled'."
     description: "This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the password for the system's domain account. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: Some problems can occur as a result of machine account password expiration, particularly if a machine is reverted to a previous point-in-time state, as is common with virtual machines. Depending on how far back the reversion is, the older machine account password stored on the machine may no longer be recognized by the domain controllers, and therefore the computer loses its domain trust. This can also disrupt non-persistent VDI implementations, and devices with write filters that disallow permanent changes to the OS volume. Some organizations may choose to exempt themselves from this recommendation and disable machine account password expiration for these situations."
     rationale: "The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003 will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account."

     rationale: "Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of a trusted path.

     rationale: "Users will need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN) connections."
     impact: "Users will see a dialog box prompt to change their password each time that they log on to the domain when their password is configured to expire between 5 and 14 days."

     title: "Ensure 'Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior' is set to 'Lock Workstation' or higher."
     description: "This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark."
     rationale: "Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials."
     impact: "If you select Lock Workstation, the workstation is locked when the smart card is removed, allowing users to leave the area, take their smart card with them, and still maintain a protected session. If you select Force Logoff, users are automatically logged off when their smart card is removed. If you select Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session, removal of the smart card disconnects the session without logging the users off. This allows the user to insert the smart card and resume the session later, or at another smart card reader-equipped computer, without having to log on again. If the session is local, this policy will function identically to Lock Workstation. Enforcing this setting on computers used by people who must log onto multiple computers in order to perform their duties could be frustrating and lower productivity. For example, if network administrators are limited to a single account but need to log into several computers simultaneously in order to effectively manage the network enforcing this setting will limit them to logging onto one computer at a time. For these reasons it is recommended that this setting only be enforced on workstations used for purposes commonly associated with typical users such as document creation and email."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Lock Workstation (or, if applicable for your environment, Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session): Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Interactive logon: Smart card removal behavior."

     description: "This policy setting determines whether the SMB client will attempt to negotiate SMB packet signing. Note: Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers in your environment. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
     rationale: "Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

The Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows Server 2003, Windows XP Professional and Windows Vista implementations of the SMB file and print sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which prevents session hijacking attacks and supports message authentication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server that is serving as a Domain Controller, file server, print server, and application server performance may be substantially slowed. Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB communications, older applications and operating systems will not be able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing, computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB signing policies are enabled on Domain Controllers running Windows Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows Server 2008 group policy processing will fail.

If configured to Required from client, the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to establish a connection.

With PKU2U, a new extension was introduced to the Negotiate authentication package, Spnego.dll. In previous versions of Windows, Negotiate decided whether to use Kerberos or NTLM for authentication. The extension SSP for Negotiate, Negoexts.dll, which is treated as an authentication protocol by Windows, supports Microsoft SSPs including PKU2U. When computers are configured to accept authentication requests by using online IDs, Negoexts.dll calls the PKU2U SSP on the computer that is used to log on. The PKU2U SSP obtains a local certificate and exchanges the policy between the peer computers.

     title: "Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'."
     description: "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: - Join a domain - Authenticate between Active Directory forests - Authenticate to down-level domains - Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP - Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM."
     rationale: "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non-R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible."
     impact: "Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it; Domain Controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). Clients that do not support NTLMv2 authentication will not be able to authenticate in the domain and access domain resources by using LM and NTLM."

An attack vector for these programs was to discover the password of the account named \"Administrator\" because that user account was created for all installations of Windows. To address this risk, in Windows Vista or newer, the built-in Administrator account is now disabled by default. In a default installation of a new computer, accounts with administrative control over the computer are initially set up in one of two ways: - - If the computer is not joined to a domain, the first user account you create has the equivalent permissions as a local administrator. If the computer is joined to a domain, no local administrator accounts are created. The Enterprise or Domain Administrator must log on to the computer and create one if a local administrator account is warranted. Once Windows is installed, the built-in Administrator account may be manually enabled, but we strongly recommend that this account remain disabled."

     rationale: "This is a legacy service - its sole purpose is to maintain a list of computers and their network shares in the environment (i.e. \"Network Neighborhood\"). If enabled, it generates a lot of unnecessary traffic, including \"elections\" to see who gets to be the \"master browser\". This noisy traffic could also aid malicious attackers in discovering online machines, because the service also allows anyone to \"browse\" for shared resources without any authentication. This service used to be running by default in older Windows versions (e.g. Windows XP), but today it only remains for backward compatibility for very old software that requires it."

     rationale: "Auditing removable storage may be useful when investigating an incident. For example, if an individual is suspected of copying sensitive information onto a USB drive."
     impact: "If no audit settings are configured, or if audit settings are too lax on the computers in your organization, security incidents might not be detected, or not enough evidence will be available for network forensic analysis after security incidents occur. However, if audit settings are too severe, critically important entries in the Security log may be obscured by all of the meaningless entries and computer performance and the available amount of data storage may be seriously affected. Companies that operate in certain regulated industries may have legal obligations to log certain events or activities."

If this problem persists, it could indicate a network issue or that packets are being modified in transit to this computer. Verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error might also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. - 4961: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. If this problem persists, it could indicate a replay attack against this computer. - 4962: IPsec dropped an inbound packet that failed a replay check. The inbound packet had too low a sequence number to ensure it was not a replay. - 4963: IPsec dropped an inbound clear text packet that should have been secured. This is usually due to the remote computer changing its IPsec policy without informing this computer. This could also be a spoofing attack attempt. - 4965: IPsec received a packet from a remote computer with an incorrect Security Parameter Index (SPI). This is usually caused by malfunctioning hardware that is corrupting packets. If these errors persist, verify that the packets sent from the remote computer are the same as those received by this computer. This error may also indicate interoperability problems with other IPsec implementations. In that case, if connectivity is not impeded, then these events can be ignored. - 5478: IPsec Services has started successfully. - 5479: IPsec Services has been shut down successfully. The shutdown of IPsec Services can put the computer at greater risk of network attack or expose the computer to potential security risks. - 5480: IPsec Services failed to get the complete list of network interfaces on the computer. This poses a potential security risk because some of the network interfaces may not get the protection provided by the applied IPsec filters.

     rationale: "This feature is designed to block exploits that use the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite technique. This protection mechanism is provided at run-time. Therefore, it helps protect applications regardless of whether they have been compiled with the latest improvements, such as the /SAFESEH option."

     title: "Ensure 'NetBT NodeType configuration' is set to 'Enabled: P-node (recommended)'."
     description: "This setting determines which method NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) uses to register and resolve names. The available methods are: - The B-node (broadcast) method only uses broadcasts. - The P-node (point-to-point) method only uses name queries to a name server (WINS). - The M-node (mixed) method broadcasts first, then queries a name server (WINS) if broadcast failed. - The H-node (hybrid) method queries a name server (WINS) first, then broadcasts if the query failed. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: P-node (recommended) (point-to-point). Note: Resolution through LMHOSTS or DNS follows these methods. If the NodeType registry value is present, it overrides any DhcpNodeType registry value. If neither NodeType nor DhcpNodeType is present, the computer uses B-node (broadcast) if there are no WINS servers configured for the network, or H-node (hybrid) if there is at least one WINS server configured."
     rationale: "In order to help mitigate the risk of NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) poisoning attacks, setting the node type to P-node (point-to-point) will prevent the system from sending out NetBIOS broadcasts."
     impact: "NetBIOS name resolution queries will require a defined and available WINS server for external NetBIOS name resolution. If a WINS server is not defined or not reachable, and the desired hostname is not defined in the local cache, local LMHOSTS or HOSTS files, NetBIOS name resolution will fail."

Please note that this setting is only available in the Security baseline (FINAL) for Windows 10 v1903 and Windows Server v1903 (or newer) release of SecGuide.admx/adml, so if you previously downloaded this template, you may need to update it from a newer Microsoft baseline to get this new NetBT NodeType configuration setting."

In an enterprise managed environment, where there is a need to control network traffic to only authorized paths, allowing users to create a Network Bridge increases the risk and attack surface from the bridged network."
     impact: "Users cannot create or configure a Network Bridge."

   - id: 15713
     title: "Disable IPv6 (Ensure TCPIP6 Parameter 'DisabledComponents' is set to '0xff (255)')."
     description: "Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is a set of protocols that computers use to exchange information over the Internet and over home and business networks. IPv6 allows for many more IP addresses to be assigned than IPv4 did. Older networking, hosts and operating systems may not support IPv6 natively. The recommended state for this setting is: DisabledComponents - 0xff (255)."
     rationale: "Since the vast majority of private enterprise managed networks have no need to utilize IPv6 (because they have access to private IPv4 addressing), disabling IPv6 components removes a possible attack surface that is also harder to monitor the traffic on. As a result, we recommend configuring IPv6 to a Disabled state when it is not needed. Configuring this recommendation to the CIS suggested state mitigates CVE-2024-38063, a TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability."
     impact: "Connectivity to other systems using IPv6 will no longer operate, and software that depends on IPv6 will cease to function. Examples of Microsoft applications that may use IPv6 include: Remote Assistance, HomeGroup, DirectAccess, Windows Mail. This registry change is documented in Microsoft Knowledge Base article 929852: How to disable IPv6 or its components in Windows. Note: This registry change does not take effect until the next reboot."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration, set the following Registry value to 0xff (255) (DWORD): HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\TCPIP6\\Parameters:DisabledComponents Note: This change does not take effect until the computer has been restarted. Note #2: Although Microsoft does not provide ADMX/ADML templates to configure this registry value, custom templates (Configure-IPv6-Components- KB929852.ADMX/ADML) are provided in the CIS Benchmark Build Kit to facilitate its configuration. Be aware though that simply turning off (not configured) the group policy setting with the template will not \"undo\" the change once applied. Instead, the opposite setting must be applied to change the registry value to the opposite state."

     rationale: "Kerberos, NTLM, and Credential manager isolate secrets by using virtualization-based security. Previous versions of Windows stored secrets in the Local Security Authority (LSA). Prior to Windows 10, the LSA stored secrets used by the operating system in its process memory. With Windows Defender Credential Guard enabled, the LSA process in the operating system talks to a new component called the isolated LSA process that stores and protects those secrets. Data stored by the isolated LSA process is protected using virtualization-based security and is not accessible to the rest of the operating system."

In addition, the setting LSA Protection will be displayed by GPME when this setting (Configures LSASS to run as a protected process) is configured. If Configures LSASS to run as a protected process was configured using an older version of the ADML/ADML templates, the new registry location will not auto-apply to the system, and assessment scans using the latest benchmark might fail. To fix this issue, the ADMX/ADML templates must be updated to the latest version, the setting removed from the GPO, and then added back in. If the Microsoft Windows 10 Benchmark is applied, LSA Protection is configured via a separate recommendation for older versions of the Windows 10 Operating System using the SecGuide.admx/adml templates.

     description: "This policy setting allows you to configure whether Secure Boot will be allowed as the platform integrity provider for BitLocker operating system drives. Secure Boot ensures that the PC's pre-boot environment only loads firmware that is digitally signed by authorized software publishers.

Secure Boot requires a system that meets the UEFI 2.3.1 Specifications for Class 2 and Class 3 computers.

     title: "Ensure 'Require additional authentication at startup' is set to 'Enabled'."
     description: "This policy setting allows you to configure whether BitLocker requires additional authentication each time the computer starts and whether you are using BitLocker with or without a Trusted Platform Module (TPM). This policy setting is applied when you turn on BitLocker. Note: Only one of the additional authentication options can be required at startup, otherwise a policy error occurs. If you want to use BitLocker on a computer without a TPM, select the \"Allow BitLocker without a compatible TPM\" check box. In this mode a USB drive is required for start-up and the key information used to encrypt the drive is stored on the USB drive, creating a USB key. When the USB key is inserted the access to the drive is authenticated and the drive is accessible. If the USB key is lost or unavailable you will need to use one of the BitLocker recovery options to access the drive. On a computer with a compatible TPM, four types of authentication methods can be used at startup to provide added protection for encrypted data. When the computer starts, it can use only the TPM for authentication, or it can also require insertion of a USB flash drive containing a startup key, the entry of a 4-digit to 20-digit personal identification number (PIN), or both. Users can configure advanced startup options in the BitLocker setup wizard. Note #2: If you want to require the use of a startup PIN and a USB flash drive, you must configure BitLocker settings using the command-line tool manage-bde instead of the BitLocker Drive Encryption setup wizard. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
     rationale: "TPM without use of a PIN will only validate early boot components and does not require a user to enter any additional authentication information. If a computer is lost or stolen in this configuration, BitLocker will not provide any additional measure of protection beyond what is provided by native Windows authentication unless the early boot components are tampered with or the encrypted drive is removed from the machine."

   - id: 15956
     title: "Ensure 'Disable new DMA devices when this computer is locked' is set to 'Enabled'."
     description: "This policy setting allows you to block direct memory access (DMA) for all hot pluggable PCI downstream ports until a user logs into Windows. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: Microsoft changed the implementation of this setting in Windows 10 R1709 to strengthen its enforcement. As a result, some hardware configurations may experience unexpected problems with this setting in that release (or newer), until updated firmware and/or drivers from the vendor are installed to correct the problem. See the Impact Statement for more information."
     rationale: "A BitLocker-protected computer may be vulnerable to Direct Memory Access (DMA) attacks when the computer is turned on or is in the Standby power state - this includes when the workstation is locked. Enabling this setting will help prevent such an attack while the computer is left unattended."
     impact: "Newly attached hardware devices that use DMA will not function on a locked (or signed out) workstation until the user has unlocked the session or logged in. Some hardware configurations may experience unexpected problems with this setting in Windows 10 R1709 (or newer), requiring updated firmware and/or drivers to correct the problem. See MSKB 4057300 for more information. We recommend testing this setting on all examples of workstation hardware before deploying it on a large scale - to see if vendor firmware and/or driver updates are first required."

Additional diagnostic data is collected that helps us to detect, diagnose and fix issues, as well as make product improvements. Required diagnostic data will always be included when you choose to send optional diagnostic data. Optional diagnostic data can also include diagnostic log files and crash dumps. Use the Limit Dump Collection and the Limit Diagnostic Log Collection policies for more granular control of what optional diagnostic data is sent.

Because no Windows Update information is collected when diagnostic data is off, important information about update failures is not sent. Microsoft uses this information to fix the causes of those failures and improve the quality of updates.

Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a configuration is particularly important because an attacker who successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log.

     title: "Ensure 'Join Microsoft MAPS' is set to 'Disabled'."
     description: "This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS), which Microsoft renamed to Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service and then Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service. Microsoft MAPS / Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections. You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new definitions and help it to protect your computer. Possible options are: - - - (0x0) Disabled (default) (0x1) Basic membership (0x2) Advanced membership Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected including where the software came from the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically and whether the actions were successful. Advanced membership in addition to basic information will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software spyware and potentially unwanted software including the location of the software file names how the software operates and how it has impacted your computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: In Windows 10 and above, Basic membership is no longer available, so setting the value to 1 Basic, or 2 Advanced, enrolls the device into Advanced membership. For more information, please visit: Turn on cloud protection in Microsoft Defender Antivirus - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Microsoft Learn."
     rationale: "The information that would be sent can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information would be automatically collected and sent. In some instances personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft states that it will not use this information to identify you or contact you. For privacy reasons in high security environments, it is best to prevent these data submissions altogether."
     impact: "None - this is the default behavior."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Microsoft Defender Antivirus\\MAPS\\Join Microsoft MAPS Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template WindowsDefender.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer)."

  # 18.10.44.6 (NG) Ensure 'Turn on Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode' is set to 'Enabled: 1'. (Automated)
   - id: 15966
     title: "Ensure 'Turn on Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode' is set to 'Enabled: 1'."
     description: "This policy setting enables application isolation through Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Application Guard). There are 4 options available: 0. Disable Microsoft Defender Application Guard 1. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge ONLY 2. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Office ONLY 3. Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge AND Microsoft Office The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled: 1 (Enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard for Microsoft Edge ONLY). Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires a 64-bit version of Windows and a CPU supporting hardware-assisted CPU virtualization (Intel VT-x or AMD-V). This feature is not officially supported on virtual hardware, although it can work on VMs (especially for testing) provided that the hardware-assisted CPU virtualization feature is exposed by the host to the guest VM. More information on system requirements for this feature can be found at System requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard (Windows 10) | Microsoft Docs Note #2: At time of publication, Microsoft Defender Application Guard in all currently released versions of Windows 10 does not yet support protection for Microsoft Office, only for Microsoft Edge. Therefore the additional available options of 2 and 3 in this setting are not yet valid. Note #3: Credential Guard and Device Guard are not currently supported when using Azure IaaS VMs."
     rationale: "Microsoft Defender Application Guard uses Windows Hypervisor to create a virtualized environment for apps that are configured to use virtualization-based security isolation. While in isolation, improper user interactions and app vulnerabilities can't compromise the kernel or any other apps running outside of the virtualized environment."
     impact: "Microsoft Defender Application Guard will be turned on for Microsoft Edge. Note: Microsoft Defender Application Guard requires the Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) (SharedAccess) service in order to operate, so an exception to disabling this service (see Section 5 in the CIS Microsoft Windows 10 benchmark only) will be required if choosing to enable Microsoft Defender Application Guard."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: 1: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Microsoft Defender Application Guard\\Turn on Microsoft Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template AppHVSI.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1703 Administrative Templates (or newer). Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named Turn on Windows Defender Application Guard in Enterprise Mode, but it was renamed to Turn on Windows Defender Application Guard in Managed Mode starting with the Windows 10 Release 1903 Administrative Templates.

     description: "This policy setting specifies whether the news and interests feature is allowed on the device. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
     rationale: "Due to privacy concerns, apps and features such as news and interests on the Windows taskbar should be treated as a possible security risk due to the potential of data being sent back to third-parties, such as Microsoft. In addition, the app may display inappropriate news and interests within the feed."
     impact: "The news and interests feature on the Windows taskbar will not be available on the device. Note: At time of benchmark publication, this setting does not hide or disable the taskbar menu options for the news and interests feature, however attempting to turn the feature back on does not cause any visible change. It is possible that Microsoft will modify this behavior to \"gray out\" the taskbar menu options in a future OS update."

   - id: 15834
     title: "Ensure 'Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage' is set to 'Enabled'."
     description: "This policy setting lets you prevent apps and features from working with files on OneDrive using the Next Generation Sync Client. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
     rationale: "Enabling this setting prevents users from accidentally (or intentionally) uploading confidential or sensitive corporate information to the OneDrive cloud service using the Next Generation Sync Client. Note: This security concern applies to any cloud-based file storage application installed on a workstation, not just the one supplied with Windows."
     impact: "Users can't access OneDrive from the OneDrive app and file picker. Windows Store apps can't access OneDrive using the WinRT API. OneDrive doesn't appear in the navigation pane in File Explorer. OneDrive files aren't kept in sync with the cloud. Users can't automatically upload photos and videos from the camera roll folder. Note: If your organization uses Office 365, be aware that this setting will prevent users from saving files to OneDrive/SkyDrive. Note #2: If your organization has decided to implement OneDrive for Business and therefore needs to except itself from this recommendation, we highly suggest that you also obtain and utilize the OneDrive.admx/adml template that is bundled with the latest OneDrive client, as noted at this link (this template is not included with the Windows Administrative Templates). Two alternative OneDrive settings in particular from that template are worth your consideration: - Allow syncing OneDrive accounts for only specific organizations - a computer - based setting that restricts OneDrive client connections to only approved tenant IDs. - Prevent users from synchronizing personal OneDrive accounts - a user-based setting that prevents use of consumer OneDrive (i.e. non-business)."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\OneDrive\\Prevent the usage of OneDrive for file storage Note: This Group Policy path is provided by the Group Policy template SkyDrive.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 8.1 & Server 2012 R2 Administrative Templates (or newer). However, we strongly recommend you only use the version included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016 Administrative Templates (or newer). Older versions of the templates had conflicting settings in different template files for both OneDrive & SkyDrive, until it was cleaned up properly in the above version. Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was named Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage, but it was renamed starting with the Windows 10 RTM (Release 1507) Administrative Templates."

Note: By default, this setting will use a self-signed certificate for RDP connections. If your organization has established the use of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for SSL/TLS encryption, then we recommend that you also configure the Server authentication certificate template setting to instruct RDP to use a certificate from your PKI instead of a self-signed one. Note that the certificate template used for this purpose must have “Client Authentication” configured as an Intended Purpose. Note also that a valid, non-expired certificate using the specified template must already be installed on the workstation for it to work. Note #2: Some third party two-factor authentication solutions (e.g. RSA Authentication Agent) can be negatively affected by this setting, as the SSL/TLS security layer will expect the user's Windows password upon initial connection attempt (before the RDP logon screen), and once successfully authenticated, pass the credential along to that Windows session on the RDP host (to complete the login). If a two-factor agent is present and expecting a different credential at the RDP logon screen, this initial connection may result in a failed logon attempt, and also effectively cause a “double logon” requirement for each and every new RDP session."

     description: "This policy setting specifies when computers in your environment will receive security updates from Windows Update or WSUS. The recommended state for this setting is: 0 - Every day. Note: This setting is only applicable if 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is selected in the recommendation 'Configure Automatic Updates'. It will have no impact if any other option is selected."
     rationale: "Although each version of Windows is thoroughly tested before release, it is possible that problems will be discovered after the products are shipped. The Configure Automatic Updates setting can help you ensure that the computers in your environment will always have the most recent critical operating system updates and service packs installed."
     impact: "If 4 - Auto download and schedule the install is selected in recommendation 'Configure Automatic Updates', critical operating system updates and service packs will automatically download every day (at 3:00 A.M., by default)."

     title: "Ensure 'Manage preview builds' is set to 'Disabled'."
     description: "This policy setting manages which updates that are received prior to the update being released. Dev Channel: Ideal for highly technical users. Insiders in the Dev Channel will receive builds from our active development branch that is earliest in a development cycle. These builds are not matched to a specific Windows 10 release. Beta Channel: Ideal for feature explorers who want to see upcoming Windows 10 features. Your feedback will be especially important here as it will help our engineers ensure key issues are fixed before a major release. Release Preview Channel (default): Insiders in the Release Preview Channel will have access to the upcoming release of Windows 10 prior to it being released to the world. These builds are supported by Microsoft. The Release Preview Channel is where we recommend companies preview and validate upcoming Windows 10 releases before broad deployment within their organization. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled. Note: Preview Build enrollment requires a telemetry level setting of 2 or higher and your domain registered on insider.windows.com. For additional information on Preview Builds, see: Managing preview builds across your organization - Windows Insider Program | Microsoft Learn."
     rationale: "It can be risky for experimental features to be allowed in an enterprise managed environment because this can introduce bugs and security holes into systems, making it easier for an attacker to gain access. It is generally preferred to only use production-ready builds."
     impact: "Preview builds are prevented from installing on the device."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Update\\Manage updates offered from Windows Update\\Manage preview builds Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default.

     title: "Ensure 'Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received' is set to 'Enabled: 180 or more days'."
     description: "This policy setting determines when Preview Build or Feature Updates are received. Defer Updates This enables devices to defer taking the next Feature Update available to your channel for up to 14 days for all the pre-release channels and up to 365 days for the Semi-Annual Channel. Or, if the device is updating from the Semi-Annual Channel, a version for the device to move to and/or stay on until the policy is updated or the device reaches end of service can be specified. Note: If you set both policies, the version specified will take precedence and the deferrals will not be in effect. Please see the Windows Release Information page for OS version information. Pause Updates To prevent Feature Updates from being received on their scheduled time, you can temporarily pause Feature Updates. The pause will remain in effect for 35 days from the specified start date or until the field is cleared (Quality Updates will still be offered). Note: If the \"Allow Diagnostic Data\" (formerly \"Allow Telemetry\") policy is set to 0, this policy will have no effect. Note #2: Starting with Windows 10 R1607, Microsoft introduced a new Windows Update (WU) client behavior called Dual Scan, with an eye to cloud-based update management. In some cases, this Dual Scan feature can interfere with Windows Updates from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and/or manual WU updates. If you are using WSUS in your environment, you may need to set the above setting to Not Configured or configure the setting Do not allow update deferral policies to cause scans against Windows Update (added in the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates) in order to prevent the Dual Scan feature from interfering. More information on Dual Scan is available at these links: - Demystifying \"Dual Scan\" - WSUS Product Team Blog - Improving Dual Scan on 1607 - WSUS Product Team Blog Note #3: Prior to Windows 10 R1703, values above 180 days are not recognized by the OS. Starting with Windows 10 R1703, the maximum number of days you can defer is 365 days."
     rationale: "In a production environment, it is preferred to only use software and features that are publicly available, after they have gone through rigorous testing in beta."
     impact: "Feature Updates will be delayed until they are publicly released to general public by Microsoft."
     remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: 180 or more days: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\Windows Components\\Windows Update\\Manage updates offered from Windows Update\\Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received Note: This Group Policy path may not exist by default. It is provided by the Group Policy template WindowsUpdate.admx/adml that is included with the Microsoft Windows 10 Release 1607 & Server 2016 Administrative Templates (or newer). Note #2: In older Microsoft Windows Administrative Templates, this setting was initially named Select when Feature Updates are received, but it was renamed to Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received starting with the Windows 10 Release 1709 Administrative Templates."
