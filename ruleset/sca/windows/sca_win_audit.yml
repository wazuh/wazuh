    title: "Ensure 'Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether local accounts that are not password protected can be used to log on from locations other than the physical computer console. If you enable this policy setting, local accounts that have blank passwords will not be able to log on to the network from remote client computers. Such accounts will only be able to log on at the keyboard of the computer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Blank passwords are a serious threat to computer security and should be forbidden through both organizational policy and suitable technical measures. In fact, the default settings for Active Directory domains require complex passwords of at least seven characters. However, if users with the ability to create new accounts bypass your domainbased password policies, they could create accounts with blank passwords. For example, a user could build a stand-alone computer, create one or more accounts with blank passwords, and then join the computer to the domain. The local accounts with blank passwords would still function. Anyone who knows the name of one of these unprotected accounts could then use it to log on."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Accounts: Limit local account use of blank passwords to console logon only."

    title: "Ensure 'Audit: Shut down system immediately if unable to log security audits' is set to 'Disabled'"
    description: "This policy setting determines whether the system shuts down if it is unable to log Security events. It is a requirement for Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC)-C2 and Common Criteria certification to prevent auditable events from occurring if the audit system is unable to log them. Microsoft has chosen to meet this requirement by halting the system and displaying a stop message if the auditing system experiences a failure. When this policy setting is enabled, the system will be shut down if a security audit cannot be logged for any reason. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "If the computer is unable to record events to the Security log, critical evidence or important troubleshooting information may not be available for review after a security incident. Also, an attacker could potentially generate a large volume of Security log events to purposely force a computer shutdown."

You can use this policy setting to prevent unauthorized users from removing data on one computer to access it on another computer on which they have local administrator privileges. The recommended state for this setting is: Administrators."
    rationale: "Users may be able to move data on removable disks to a different computer where they have administrative privileges. The user could then take ownership of any file, grant themselves full control, and view or modify any file. The fact that most removable storage devices will eject media by pressing a mechanical button diminishes the advantage of this policy setting."

This security setting determines who is allowed to install a printer driver as part of connecting to a shared printer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled. Note: This setting does not affect the ability to add a local printer. This setting does not affect Administrators."
    rationale: "It may be appropriate in some organizations to allow users to install printer drivers on their own workstations. However, in a high security environment, you should allow only Administrators, not users, to do this, because printer driver installation may unintentionally cause the computer to become less stable. A malicious user could install inappropriate printer drivers in a deliberate attempt to damage the computer, or a user might accidentally install malicious software that masquerades as a printer driver. It is feasible for an attacker to disguise a Trojan horse program as a printer driver. The program may appear to users as if they must use it to print, but such a program could unleash malicious code on your computer network."

    description: "This policy setting determines whether all secure channel traffic that is initiated by the domain member must be signed or encrypted. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created. After it joins the domain, the computer uses the password for that account to create a secure channel with the Domain Controller for its domain every time that it restarts. Requests that are sent on the secure channel are authenticated and sensitive information such as passwords are encrypted-but the channel is not integrity-checked, and not all information is encrypted. Digital encryption and signing of the secure channel is a good idea where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials as they are sent to the Domain Controller."

    description: "This policy setting determines whether a domain member should attempt to negotiate whether all secure channel traffic that it initiates must be digitally signed. Digital signatures protect the traffic from being modified by anyone who captures the data as it traverses the network. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "When a computer joins a domain, a computer account is created.

    description: "This policy setting determines whether a domain member can periodically change its computer account password. Computers that cannot automatically change their account passwords are potentially vulnerable, because an attacker might be able to determine the password for the system's domain account. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "The default configuration for Windows Server 2003-based computers that belong to a domain is that they are automatically required to change the passwords for their accounts every 30 days. If you disable this policy setting, computers that run Windows Server 2003 will retain the same passwords as their computer accounts. Computers that are no longer able to automatically change their account password are at risk from an attacker who could determine the password for the computer's domain account."

    description: "When this policy setting is enabled, a secure channel can only be established with Domain Controllers that are capable of encrypting secure channel data with a strong (128-bit) session key. To enable this policy setting, all Domain Controllers in the domain must be able to encrypt secure channel data with a strong key, which means all Domain Controllers must be running Microsoft Windows 2000 or newer. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Session keys that are used to establish secure channel communications between Domain Controllers and member computers are much stronger in Windows 2000 than they were in previous Microsoft operating systems. Whenever possible, you should take advantage of these stronger session keys to help protect secure channel communications from attacks that attempt to hijack network sessions and eavesdropping. (Eavesdropping is a form of hacking in which network data is read or altered in transit. The data can be modified to hide or change the sender, or be redirected.)"
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Domain member: Require strong (Windows 2000 or later) session key."

Enable this policy setting to prevent intruders from collecting account names visually from the screens of desktop or laptop computers in your organization. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "An attacker with access to the console (for example, someone with physical access or someone who is able to connect to the server through Remote Desktop Services) could view the name of the last user who logged on to the server. The attacker could then try to guess the password, use a dictionary, or use a brute-force attack to try and log on."

    description: "This policy setting determines whether users must press CTRL+ALT+DEL before they log on. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "Microsoft developed this feature to make it easier for users with certain types of physical impairments to log on to computers that run Windows. If users are not required to press CTRL+ALT+DEL, they are susceptible to attacks that attempt to intercept their passwords. If CTRL+ALT+DEL is required before logon, user passwords are communicated by means of a trusted path. An attacker could install a Trojan horse program that looks like the standard Windows logon dialog box and capture the user's password. The attacker would then be able to log on to the compromised account with whatever level of privilege that user has."

It is recommended that you configure this policy setting to at least 5 days but no more than 14 days to sufficiently warn users when their passwords will expire. The recommended state for this setting is: between 5 and 14 days."
    rationale: "It is recommended that user passwords be configured to expire periodically. Users will need to be warned that their passwords are going to expire, or they may inadvertently be locked out of the computer when their passwords expire. This condition could lead to confusion for users who access the network locally, or make it impossible for users to access your organization's network through dial-up or virtual private network (VPN) connections."

    description: "This policy setting determines what happens when the smart card for a logged-on user is removed from the smart card reader. The recommended state for this setting is: Lock Workstation. Configuring this setting to Force Logoff or Disconnect if a Remote Desktop Services session also conforms to the benchmark."
    rationale: "Users sometimes forget to lock their workstations when they are away from them, allowing the possibility for malicious users to access their computers. If smart cards are used for authentication, the computer should automatically lock itself when the card is removed to ensure that only the user with the smart card is accessing resources using those credentials."

    description: "This policy setting determines whether packet signing is required by the SMB client component. Note: When Windows Vista-based computers have this policy setting enabled and they connect to file or print shares on remote servers, it is important that the setting is synchronized with its companion setting, Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always), on those servers. For more information about these settings, see the 'Microsoft network client and server: Digitally sign communications (four related settings)' section in Chapter 5 of the Threats and Countermeasures guide. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Session hijacking uses tools that allow attackers who have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end, or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and modify unsigned SMB packets and then modify the traffic and forward it so that the server might perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data. SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows operating systems. It is the basis of NetBIOS and many other protocols. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data transmission will not take place."

It is recommended that you disable this policy setting unless there is a strong business case to enable it. If this policy setting is enabled, unencrypted passwords will be allowed across the network. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled."
    rationale: "If you enable this policy setting, the server can transmit passwords in plaintext across the network to other computers that offer SMB services, which is a significant security risk.

This policy setting controls null session access to shares on your computers by adding RestrictNullSessAccess with the value 1 in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LanManServer\\Parameters registry key. This registry value toggles null session shares on or off to control whether the server service restricts unauthenticated clients' access to named resources.

    description: "This policy setting determines how network logons that use local accounts are authenticated. The Classic option allows precise control over access to resources, including the ability to assign different types of access to different users for the same resource. The Guest only option allows you to treat all users equally. In this context, all users authenticate as Guest only to receive the same access level to a given resource. The recommended state for this setting is: Classic - local users authenticate as themselves. Note: This setting does not affect interactive logons that are performed remotely by using such services as Telnet or Remote Desktop Services (formerly called Terminal Services)."
    rationale: "With the Guest only model, any user who can authenticate to your computer over the network does so with guest privileges, which probably means that they will not have write access to shared resources on that computer. Although this restriction does increase security, it makes it more difficult for authorized users to access shared resources on those computers because ACLs on those resources must include access control entries (ACEs) for the Guest account. With the Classic model, local accounts should be password protected. Otherwise, if Guest access is enabled, anyone can use those user accounts to access shared system resources."

    description: "This policy setting determines whether the LAN Manager (LM) hash value for the new password is stored when the password is changed. The LM hash is relatively weak and prone to attack compared to the cryptographically stronger Microsoft Windows NT hash. Since LM hashes are stored on the local computer in the security database, passwords can then be easily compromised if the database is attacked. Note: Older operating systems and some third-party applications may fail when this policy setting is enabled. Also, note that the password will need to be changed on all accounts after you enable this setting to gain the proper benefit. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "The SAM file can be targeted by attackers who seek access to username and password hashes. Such attacks use special tools to crack passwords, which can then be used to impersonate users and gain access to resources on your network.

    title: "Ensure 'Network security: LAN Manager authentication level' is set to 'Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM'"
    description: "LAN Manager (LM) was a family of early Microsoft client/server software (predating Windows NT) that allowed users to link personal computers together on a single network. LM network capabilities included transparent file and print sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants, and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when they perform the following operations: -Join a domain -Authenticate between Active Directory forests -Authenticate to down-level domains -Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, or Windows XP -Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain. The Network security: LAN Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the level of authentication protocol used by clients, the level of session security negotiated, and the level of authentication accepted by servers. The recommended state for this setting is: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM."
    rationale: "Windows 2000 and Windows XP clients were configured by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default settings in OSes predating Windows Vista / Windows Server 2008 (non- R2) allowed all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources. However, this meant that LM responses - the weakest form of authentication response - were sent over the network, and it was potentially possible for attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2 for older clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to authenticate with Windows Server 2003 or newer Domain Controllers. For these reasons, it is strongly preferred to restrict the use of LM & NTLM (non-v2) as much as possible."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to: Send NTLMv2 response only. Refuse LM & NTLM: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Windows Settings\\Security Settings\\Local Policies\\Security Options\\Network security: LAN Manager authentication level."

The recommended state for this setting is: Negotiate signing. Configuring this setting to Require signing also conforms to the benchmark."
    rationale: "Unsigned network traffic is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks in which an intruder captures the packets between the client and server, modifies them, and then forwards them to the server. For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a server to make decisions that are based on false or altered data from the LDAP queries. To lower this risk in your network, you can implement strong physical security measures to protect the network infrastructure. Also, you can make all types of man-in-the-middle attacks extremely difficult if you require digital signatures on all network packets by means of IPsec authentication headers."

    title: "Ensure 'Turn off the Windows Messenger Customer Experience Improvement Program' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "This policy setting specifies whether Windows Messenger can collect anonymous information about how the Windows Messenger software and service is used. Microsoft uses information collected through the Customer Experience Improvement Program to detect software flaws so that they can be corrected more quickly, enabling this setting will reduce the amount of data Microsoft is able to gather for this purpose. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "Large enterprise managed environments may not want to have information collected by Microsoft from managed client computers."

    description: "This policy setting controls whether or not errors are reported to Microsoft. Error Reporting is used to report information about a system or application that has failed or has stopped responding and is used to improve the quality of the product. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled."
    rationale: "If a Windows Error occurs in a secure, enterprise managed environment, the error should be reported directly to IT staff for troubleshooting and remediation. There is no benefit to the corporation to report these errors directly to Microsoft, and there is some risk of unknowingly exposing sensitive data as part of the error."

    title: "Ensure 'Enable RPC Endpoint Mapper Client Authentication' is set to 'Enabled'"
    description: "This policy setting controls whether RPC clients authenticate with the Endpoint Mapper Service when the call they are making contains authentication information. The Endpoint Mapper Service on computers running Windows NT4 (all service packs) cannot process authentication information supplied in this manner. This policy setting can cause a specific issue with 1-way forest trusts if it is applied to the trusting domain DCs (see Microsoft KB3073942), so we do not recommend applying it to Domain Controllers."
    rationale: "Anonymous access to RPC services could result in accidental disclosure of information to unauthenticated users."
    remediation: "To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\\Policies\\Administrative Templates\\System\\Remote Procedure Call\\Enable RPC Endpoint Mapper Client Authentication."

    title: "Ensure 'Restrict Unauthenticated RPC clients' is set to 'Enabled: Authenticated'"
    description: "This policy setting controls how the RPC server runtime handles unauthenticated RPC clients connecting to RPC servers. This policy setting impacts all RPC applications. In a domain environment this policy setting should be used with caution as it can impact a wide range of functionality including group policy processing itself. Reverting a change to this policy setting can require manual intervention on each affected machine. This policy setting should never be applied to a Domain Controller. A client will be considered an authenticated client if it uses a named pipe to communicate with the server or if it uses RPC Security. RPC Interfaces that have specifically requested to be accessible by unauthenticated clients may be exempt from this restriction, depending on the selected value for this policy setting. -- None allows all RPC clients to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. -- Authenticated allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. Exemptions are granted to interfaces that have requested them. -- Authenticated without exceptions allows only authenticated RPC Clients (per the definition above) to connect to RPC Servers running on the machine on which the policy setting is applied. No exceptions are allowed. This value has the potential to cause serious problems and is not recommended.'"
    rationale: "Unauthenticated RPC communication can create a security vulnerability."
