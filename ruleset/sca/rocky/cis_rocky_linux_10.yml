     description: "The Linux overlay kernel module, commonly referred to as Overlayfs, is a union mount filesystem. It allows the user to overlay one file system on top of another, and creates a single, unified view."
     rationale: "The overlay kernel module has known CVE's: CVE-2023-32629, CVE-2023-2640, and CVE-2023-0386. Disabling the overlay kernel module reduces the local attack surface by removing support for unnecessary filesystem types and mitigates potential risks associated with unauthorized execution of setuid files, enhancing the overall system security."

     title: "Ensure squashfs kernel module is not available."
     description: "The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems. A squashfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
     rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
     impact: "As Snap packages utilize squashfs as a compressed filesystem, disabling squashfs will cause Snap packages to fail. Snap application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store (\"App store\"), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment."

     title: "Ensure usb-storage kernel module is not available."
     description: "USB storage provides a means to transfer and store files ensuring persistence and availability of the files independent of network connection status.

  # 1.1.1.11 Ensure unused filesystems kernel modules are not available. (Manual)
   - id: 18509
     title: "Ensure unused filesystems kernel modules are not available."
     description: "Filesystem kernel modules are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded into the Linux kernel to extend its filesystem capabilities, or so-called base kernel, of an operating system. Filesystem kernel modules are typically used to add support for new hardware (as device drivers), or for adding system calls."
     rationale: "While loadable filesystem kernel modules are a convenient method of modifying the running kernel, this can be abused by attackers on a compromised system to prevent detection of their processes or files, allowing them to maintain control over the system. Many rootkits make use of loadable filesystem kernel modules in this way. Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it. The following filesystem kernel modules have known CVE's and should be made unavailable if no dependencies exist: - ceph - CVE-2022-0670 - cifs - CVE-2022-29869 - exfat CVE-2022-29973 - ext CVE-2022-1184 - fat CVE-2022-22043 - fscache CVE-2022-3630 - fuse CVE-2023-0386 - gfs2 CVE-2023-3212 - nfs_common CVE-2023-6660 - nfsd CVE-2022-43945 - smbfs_common CVE-2022-2585."
     impact: "This list may be quite extensive and covering all edges cases is difficult. Therefore, it's crucial to carefully consider the implications and dependencies before making any changes to the filesystem kernel module configurations."
     remediation: "- IF - the module is available in the running kernel: - Unload the filesystem kernel module from the kernel - Create a file ending in .conf with install filesystem kernel modules /bin/false in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory - Create a file ending in .conf with deny list filesystem kernel modules in the /etc/modprobe.d/ directory WARNING: unloading, disabling or denylisting filesystem modules that are in use on the system may be FATAL. It is extremely important to thoroughly review the filesystems returned by the audit before following the remediation procedure. Example of unloading the gfs2kernel module: modprobe -r gfs2 2>/dev/null rmmod gfs2 2>/dev/null Example of fully disabling the gfs2 kernel module: printf '%s\\n' \"\" \"blacklist gfs2\" \"install gfs2 /bin/false\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/gfs2.conf Note: - Disable a kernel module by modifying the command above for each unused filesystem kernel module - The example gfs2 must be updated with the appropriate module name for the command or example script bellow to run correctly. Below is an example script that can be modified to use on various filesystem kernel modules manual remediation process: Example Script #!/usr/bin/env bash { a_output2=(); a_output3=(); l_dl=\"\" # Initialize arrays and clear variables l_mod_name=\"gfs2\" # set module name l_mod_type=\"fs\" # set module type l_mod_path=\"$(readlink -f /usr/lib/modules/**/kernel/$l_mod_type || readlink -f /lib/modules/**/kernel/$l_mod_type)\" f_module_fix() { l_dl=\"y\" # Set to ignore duplicate checks a_showconfig=() # Create array with modprobe output while IFS= read -r l_showconfig; do a_showconfig+=(\"$l_showconfig\") done < <(modprobe --showconfig | grep -P -- '\\b(install|blacklist)\\h+'\"${l_mod_name//-/_}\"'\\b') if lsmod | grep \"$l_mod_name\" &> /dev/null; then # Check if the module is currently loaded a_output2+=(\" - unloading kernel module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\"\") modprobe -r \"$l_mod_name\" 2>/dev/null; rmmod \"$l_mod_name\" 2>/dev/null fi if ! grep -Pq -- '\\binstall\\h+'\"${l_mod_name//- /_}\"'\\h+(\\/usr)?\\/bin\\/(true|false)\\b' <<< \"${a_showconfig[*]}\"; then a_output2+=(\" - setting kernel module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\" to \\\"$(readlink -f /bin/false)\\\"\") printf '%s\\n' \"install $l_mod_name $(readlink -f /bin/false)\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/\"$l_mod_name\".conf fi if ! grep -Pq -- '\\bblacklist\\h+'\"${l_mod_name//-/_}\"'\\b' <<< \"${a_showconfig[*]}\"; then a_output2+=(\" - denylisting kernel module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\"\") printf '%s\\n' \"blacklist $l_mod_name\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/\"$l_mod_name\".conf fi } for l_mod_base_directory in $l_mod_path; do # Check if the module exists on the system if [ -d \"$l_mod_base_directory/${l_mod_name/-/\\/}\" ] && [ -n \"$(ls -A \"$l_mod_base_directory/${l_mod_name/-/\\/}\")\" ]; then a_output3+=(\" - \\\"$l_mod_base_directory\\\"\") [[ \"$l_mod_name\" =~ overlay ]] && l_mod_name=\"${l_mod_name::-2}\" [ \"$l_dl\" != \"y\" ] && f_module_fix else echo -e \" - kernel module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\" doesn't exist in \\\"$l_mod_base_directory\\\"\" fi done [ \"${#a_output3[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" -- INFO --\" \" - module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\" exists in:\" \"${a_output3[@]}\" [ \"${#a_output2[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \"${a_output2[@]}\" || printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - No changes needed\" printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - remediation of kernel module: \\\"$l_mod_name\\\" complete\" \"\" }."

  # 1.1.2.1.1 Ensure /tmp is tmpfs or a separate partition. (Automated)
   - id: 18510
     title: "Ensure /tmp is tmpfs or a separate partition."
     description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. Note: If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in a systemd unit file. There is an exception to this when a system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence over a systemd unit file."
     rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
     impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based."
     remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Note: the size=2G is an example of setting a specific size for tmpfs. Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment: <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

     title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit."
     description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
     rationale: "The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log/audit directory contains the audit.log file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/log/audit and cause auditd to trigger its space_left_action as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Configuring /var/log/audit as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. As /var/log/audit contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
     impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
     remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

     description: "SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing: - Enforcing - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system. - Permissive - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development. - Disabled - disables most of the SELinux kernel and application code, leaving the system running without any SELinux protection. Note: You can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive: # semanage permissive -a httpd_t."

  # 1.3.1.5 Ensure the SELinux mode is enforcing. (Automated)
   - id: 18546
     title: "Ensure the SELinux mode is enforcing."
     description: "SELinux can run in one of three modes: disabled, permissive, or enforcing: - Enforcing - Is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system. - Permissive - The system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development. - Disabled - Is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future Note: You can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the httpd_t domain permissive: # semanage permissive -a httpd_t."
     rationale: "Running SELinux in disabled mode the system not only avoids enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future. Running SELinux in Permissive mode, though helpful for developing SELinux policy, only logs access denial entries, but does not deny any operations. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000445-GPOS-00199, SRG-OS-000134-GPOS-00068."
     impact: "Running SELinux in Enforcing mode may block intended access to files or processes if the SELinux policy is not correctly configured. If this occurs, review the system logs for details and update labels or policy as appropriate."
     remediation: "1. Edit /etc/selinux/config and update the SELINUX parameter to SELINUX=enforcing Example: SELINUX=enforcing 2. Update the SELinux running state to enforcing: - If SELinux is currently disabled: Run the following command to create /.autorelabel: # touch /.autorelabel Run the following command to reboot the system: # reboot WARNING: The autorelabel may be a long running process and require significant downtime. This should be planed for before executing the reboot! - If SELinux is not currently disabled: Run the following commands to set SELinux's running mode to Enforcing: # setenforce 1."

     description: "The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process (the \"tracer\") may observe and control the execution of another process (the \"tracee\"), and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers. The sysctl settings (writable only with CAP_SYS_PTRACE) are: - 0 - classic ptrace permissions: a process can PTRACE_ATTACH to any other process running under the same uid, as long as it is dumpable (i.e. did not transition uids, start privileged, or have called prctl(PR_SET_DUMPABLE...) already). Similarly, PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged. - 1 - restricted ptrace: a process must have a predefined relationship with the inferior it wants to call PTRACE_ATTACH on. By default, this relationship is that of only its descendants when the above classic criteria is also met. To change the relationship, an inferior can call prctl(PR_SET_PTRACER, debugger, ...) to declare an allowed debugger PID to call PTRACE_ATTACH on the inferior. Using PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged. - 2 - admin-only attach: only processes with CAP_SYS_PTRACE may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH, or through children calling PTRACE_TRACEME. - 3 - no attach: no processes may use ptrace with PTRACE_ATTACH nor via PTRACE_TRACEME.

Applications will be unable to use algorithms and protocols that do not meet the policy, unless you explicitly request the application to do so. The system-wide crypto-policies followed by the crypto core components allow consistently deprecating and disabling algorithms system-wide. The LEGACY This policy ensures maximum compatibility with legacy systems at the cost of being less secure. It allows the TLS 1.2, and TLS 1.3 protocols, as well as IKEv2 and SSH2. DSA is not allowed, while RSA and Diffie-Hellman parameters are accepted if no less than 2048 bits. This policy provides at least 80-bit security."

     rationale: "The SHA-1 hash function has an inherently weak design, and advancing cryptanalysis has made it vulnerable to attacks. The most significant danger for a hash algorithm is when a \"collision\" which happens when two different pieces of data produce the same hash value occurs. This hashing algorithm has been considered weak since 2005. Note: The use of SHA-1 with hashbased message authentication codes (HMAC) do not rely on the collision resistance of the corresponding hash function, and therefore the recent attacks on SHA-1 have a significantly lower impact on the use of SHA-1 for HMAC.

     title: "Ensure system wide crypto policy macs are configured."
     description: "Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm is a family of cryptographic functions that is parameterized by a symmetric key. Each of the functions can act on input data (called a “message”) of variable length to produce an output value of a specified length. The output value is called the MAC of the input message. A MAC algorithm can be used to provide data-origin authentication and data-integrity protection."
     rationale: "Weak algorithms continue to have a great deal of attention as a weak spot that can be exploited with expanded computing power. An attacker that breaks the algorithm could take advantage of a MiTM position to decrypt the tunnel and capture credentials and information. A MAC algorithm must be computationally infeasible to determine the MAC of a message without knowledge of the key, even if one has already seen the results of using that key to compute the MAC's of other messages."
     remediation: "Note: - The commands below are written for the included DEFAULT system-wide crypto policy. If another policy is in use and follows local site policy, replace DEFAULT with the name of your system-wide crypto policy. - Multiple subpolicies may be assigned to a policy as a colon separated list. e.g. DEFAULT:NO-SHA1:NO-SSHCBC - Subpolicies: o Not included in the update-crypto-policies --set command will not be applied to the system wide crypto policy. o must exist before they can be applied to the system wide crypto policy. o .pmod file filenames must be in all upper case, upper case, e.g. NO- WEAKMAC.pmod, or they will not be read by the update-crypto-policies --set command. Create or edit a file in /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/ ending in .pmod and add or modify one of the following lines: mac = -*-128* # Disables weak macs Example: # printf '%s\\n' \"# This is a subpolicy to disable weak macs\" \"mac = -*-128\" >> /etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/NO-WEAKMAC.pmod Run the following command to update the system-wide cryptographic policy # update-crypto-policies --set <CRYPTO_POLICY>:<CRYPTO_SUBPOLICY1>:<CRYPTO_SUBPOLICY2>:<CRYPTO_SUBPOLICY3> Example: update-crypto-policies --set DEFAULT:NO-SHA1:NO-WEAKMAC Run the following command to reboot the system to make your cryptographic settings effective for already running services and applications: # reboot."

   - id: 18565
     title: "Ensure system wide crypto policy disables cbc for ssh."
     description: "Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) is an algorithm that uses a block cipher."
     rationale: "A vulnerability exists in SSH messages that employ CBC mode that may allow an attacker to recover plaintext from a block of ciphertext. If exploited, this attack can potentially allow an attacker to recover up to 32 bits of plaintext from an arbitrary block of ciphertext from a connection secured using the SSH protocol."

     remediation: "Note: - The commands below are written for the included DEFAULT system-wide crypto policy.

     title: "Ensure rpcbind services are not in use."
     description: "The rpcbind utility maps RPC services to the ports on which they listen. RPC processes notify rpcbind when they start, registering the ports they are listening on and the RPC program numbers they expect to serve. The client system then contacts rpcbind on the server with a particular RPC program number. The rpcbind.service redirects the client to the proper port number so it can communicate with the requested service. Portmapper is an RPC service, which always listens on tcp and udp 111, and is used to map other RPC services (such as nfs, nlockmgr, quotad, mountd, etc.) to their corresponding port number on the server. When a remote host makes an RPC call to that server, it first consults with portmap to determine where the RPC server is listening."

     title: "Ensure snmp services are not in use."
     description: "Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a widely used protocol for monitoring the health and welfare of network equipment, computer equipment and devices like UPSs. Net-SNMP is a suite of applications used to implement SNMPv1 (RFC 1157), SNMPv2 (RFCs 1901-1908), and SNMPv3 (RFCs 3411-3418) using both IPv4 and IPv6. Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. \"SNMPv2 historic\" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system."
     rationale: "The SNMP server can communicate using SNMPv1, which transmits data in the clear and does not require authentication to execute commands. SNMPv3 replaces the simple/clear text password sharing used in SNMPv2 with more securely encoded parameters. If the the SNMP service is not required, the net-snmp package should be removed to reduce the attack surface of the system. Note: If SNMP is required: - The server should be configured for SNMP v3 only. User Authentication and Message Encryption should be configured. If SNMP v2 is absolutely necessary, modify the community strings' values. -."
     impact: "There may be packages that are dependent on the net-snmp package. If the net-snmp package is removed, these packages will be removed as well. Before removing the net-snmp package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system. If a dependent package is required, stop and mask the snmpd.service leaving the net-snmp package installed."
     remediation: "Run the following commands to stop snmpd.service and remove net-snmp package: # systemctl stop snmpd.service # dnf remove net-snmp - OR - If the package is required for dependencies: Run the following commands to stop and mask the snmpd.service: # systemctl stop snmpd.service # systemctl mask snmpd.service."

The client-server relationship is strictly hierarchical: a client might synchronize its system time to that of the server, but the server’s system time will never be influenced by that of a client. o This directive can be used multiple times to specify multiple servers. o The directive is immediately followed by either the name of the server, or its IP address. - pool o The syntax of this directive is similar to that for the server directive, except that it is used to specify a pool of NTP servers rather than a single NTP server.

     description: "crontab is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though files are created, they are not intended to be edited directly. If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab. Users are not allowed to edit the file directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. Note: - Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user - The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs."
     rationale: "On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files."

You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow. The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at. An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user may use at. If neither file exists, only the superuser is allowed to use at."
     rationale: "On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule at jobs. Using the at.allow file to control who can run at jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files."

In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network.

Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems.

     title: "Ensure net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route is configured."
     description: "The accept_source_route option causes network interfaces to accept packets with the Strict Source Route (SSR) or Loose Source Routing (LSR) option set. net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route controls accepting of all IPv4 packets with the SSR or LSR option set on newly added network interfaces. In networking, source routing allows a sender to partially or fully specify the route packets take through a network. In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be used."
     rationale: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route to 0 disables the system from accepting source routed packets. Assume this system was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the system as a way to reach the private address systems. If, however, source routed packets were allowed, they could be used to gain access to the private address systems as the route could be specified, rather than rely on routing protocols that did not allow this routing."

     description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN/ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."

A zone target may be set to ACCEPT, %%REJECT%%, or DROP. This can be used to accept, reject, or drop every packet that doesn't match any rule (port, service, etc). The ACCEPT target is used in the trusted zone to accept every packet not matching any rule, e.g. accept all. The %%REJECT%% target is used in the block zone to reject, with default firewall reject type, every packet not matching any rule. The DROP target is used in the drop zone to drop every packet not matching any rule. If the target is not specified, every packet not matching and rule will be rejected. Note: The target may also be set to default. The default target provides a convenient way to implement a \"deny by default, allow by exception\" policy within a firewalld zone, while still allowing essential ICMP traffic."

  # 5.1.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured. (Automated)
   - id: 18665
     title: "Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured."
     description: "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
     rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
     remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax parameters above any Include and Match entries according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3 Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location."

  # 5.1.8 Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled. (Automated)

     title: "Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled."
     description: "The DisableForwarding parameter disables all forwarding features, including X11, ssh-agent(1), TCP and StreamLocal. This option overrides all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations. - X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote graphic connections. - ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh. - SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
     rationale: "Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh-agent to authenticate them to other servers Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
     impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."
     remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the DisableForwarding parameter to yes above any Include entry as follows: DisableForwarding yes Note: First occurrence of an option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding.

     title: "Ensure sshd LoginGraceTime is configured."
     description: "The LoginGraceTime parameter specifies the time allowed for successful authentication to the SSH server. The longer the Grace period is the more open unauthenticated connections can exist. Like other session controls in this session the Grace Period should be limited to appropriate organizational limits to ensure the service is available for needed access."
     rationale: "Setting the LoginGraceTime parameter to a low number will minimize the risk of successful brute force attacks to the SSH server. It will also limit the number of concurrent unauthenticated connections While the recommended setting is 60 seconds (1 Minute), set the number based on site policy."
     remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the LoginGraceTime parameter to 60 seconds or less above any Include entry as follows: LoginGraceTime 60 Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location."

     title: "Ensure sshd LogLevel is configured."
     description: "SSH provides several logging levels with varying amounts of verbosity. The DEBUG options are specifically not recommended other than strictly for debugging SSH communications. These levels provide so much data that it is difficult to identify important security information, and may violate the privacy of users."
     rationale: "The INFO level is the basic level that only records login activity of SSH users. In many situations, such as Incident Response, it is important to determine when a particular user was active on a system. The logout record can eliminate those users who disconnected, which helps narrow the field. The VERBOSE level specifies that login and logout activity as well as the key fingerprint for any SSH key used for login will be logged. This information is important for SSH key management, especially in legacy environments."

PASS_MAX_DAYS <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)."
     rationale: "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity. We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden."
     impact: "The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password changes or users will be unable to change their password. Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to: Indication of compromise - - Change of user roles - When a user leaves the organization. Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but it’s also been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password."

Unfortunately, passwords are compromised and if an attacker is targeting a specific individual user account, with foreknowledge of data about that user, reuse of old, potentially compromised passwords, may cause a security breach. By restricting the frequency of password changes, an administrator can prevent users from repeatedly changing their password in an attempt to circumvent password reuse controls."

     description: "A cryptographic hash function converts an arbitrary-length input into a fixed length output. Password hashing performs a one-way transformation of a password, turning the password into another string, called the hashed password. ENCRYPT_METHOD (string) - This defines the system default encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are specified on the command line). It can take one of these values: - MD5 - MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password - SHA256 - SHA256-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password - SHA512 - SHA512-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password - BCRYPT - BCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password - YESCRYPT - YESCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password - DES - DES-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password (default) Note: - This parameter overrides the deprecated MD5_CRYPT_ENAB variable. - This parameter will only affect the generation of group passwords. - The generation of user passwords is done by PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with the PAM configuration. -."
     rationale: "The SHA-512 and yescrypt algorithms provide a stronger hash than other algorithms used by Linux for password hash generation. A stronger hash provides additional protection to the system by increasing the level of effort needed for an attacker to successfully determine local group passwords."

If it is determined that the password algorithm being used is not sha512 or yescrypt, once it is changed, it is recommended that all group passwords be updated to use the stronger hashing algorithm.

In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either Octal or Symbolic values: - Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. root user Shell Configuration Files: - /root/.bash_profile - Is executed to configure the root users' shell before the initial command prompt.

  # 5.4.3.3 Ensure default user umask is configured. (Automated)
   - id: 18726
     title: "Ensure default user umask is configured."
     description: "The user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permission for newly created directories and files. In Linux, the default permissions for any newly created directory is 0777 (rwxrwxrwx), and for any newly created file it is 0666 (rw-rw-rw-). The umask modifies the default Linux permissions by restricting (masking) these permissions. The umask is not simply subtracted, but is processed bitwise. Bits set in the umask are cleared in the resulting file mode. umask can be set with either Octal or Symbolic values: - Octal (Numeric) Value - Represented by either three or four digits. ie umask 0027 or umask 027. If a four digit umask is used, the first digit is ignored. The remaining three digits effect the resulting permissions for user, group, and world/other respectively. - Symbolic Value - Represented by a comma separated list for User u, group g, and world/other o. The permissions listed are not masked by umask. ie a umask set by umask u=rwx,g=rx,o= is the Symbolic equivalent of the Octal umask 027. This umask would set a newly created directory with file mode drwxr-x--- and a newly created file with file mode rw-r-----. The default umask can be set to use the pam_umask module or in a System Wide Shell Configuration File. The user creating the directories or files has the discretion of changing the permissions via the chmod command, or choosing a different default umask by adding the umask command into a User Shell Configuration File, (.bash_profile or .bashrc), in their home directory. Setting the default umask: - pam_umask module: o will set the umask according to the system default in /etc/login.defs and user settings, solving the problem of different umask settings with different shells, display managers, remote sessions etc. o umask=<mask> value in the /etc/login.defs file is interpreted as Octal o Setting USERGROUPS_ENAB to yes in /etc/login.defs (default): ▪ will enable setting of the umask group bits to be the same as owner bits. (examples: 022 -> 002, 077 -> 007) for non-root users, if the uid is the same as gid, and username is the same as the <primary group name> ▪ userdel will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and useradd will create by default a group with the name of the user - System Wide Shell Configuration File: o /etc/profile - used to set system wide environmental variables on users shells. The variables are sometimes the same ones that are in the .bash_profile, however this file is used to set an initial PATH or PS1 for all shell users of the system. is only executed for interactive login shells, or shells executed with the --login parameter. o /etc/profile.d - /etc/profile will execute the scripts within /etc/profile.d/*.sh. It is recommended to place your configuration in a shell script within /etc/profile.d to set your own system wide environmental variables. o /etc/bashrc - System wide version of .bashrc. In Fedora derived distributions, etc/bashrc also invokes /etc/profile.d/*.sh if non-login shell, but redirects output to /dev/null if non-interactive. Is only executed for interactive shells or if BASH_ENV is set to /etc/bashrc. User Shell Configuration Files: - ~/.bash_profile - Is executed to configure your shell before the initial command prompt. Is only read by login shells. - ~/.bashrc - Is executed for interactive shells. only read by a shell that's both interactive and non-login umask is set by order of precedence. If umask is set in multiple locations, this order of precedence will determine the system's default umask. Order of precedence: 1. A file in /etc/profile.d/ ending in .sh - This will override any other system- wide umask setting 2. In the file /etc/profile 3. On the pam_umask.so module in /etc/pam.d/postlogin 4. In the file /etc/login.defs 5. In the file /etc/default/login."
     rationale: "Setting a secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A permissive umask value could result in directories or files with excessive permissions that can be read and/or written to by unauthorized users. Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00228, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227."
     remediation: "1. Run the following script to comment out all occurrences of umask that are less restrictive than 027 in files ending in *.sh in the /etc/profile.d/ directory: #!/usr/bin/env bash { while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' l_file; do sed -ri '/^\\s*umask\\s+0?(0[01][0-7]|0[0-7][^7]|[^0][0-7][0- 7])(\\s*|\\s+.*)$/s/^/# /' \"$l_file\" done < <(find /etc/profile.d/ -type f -name '*.sh' -print0) } 2. Create or edit a file in /etc/profile.d/ ending in *.sh and add or modify the following line: umask 0027 Example: # printf '%s\\n' \"\" \"umask 027\" >> /etc/profile.d/60-default_umask.sh 3. Edit /etc/login.defs and add or update the following line: UMASK 027 Notes: - This method only applies to bash and shell. If other shells are supported on the - system, it is recommended that their configuration files also are checked If the pam_umask.so module is going to be used to set umask, ensure that it's not being overridden by another setting. Refer to the PAM_UMASK(8) man page for more information."

     rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document.

     description: "Local accounts can use shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, the passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
     rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Notes: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."

The following script will: - remove excessive permissions on dot files within interactive users' home directories - change ownership of dot files within interactive users' home directories to the user - change group ownership of dot files within interactive users' home directories to the user's primary group list .forward and .rhost files to be investigated and manually deleted - #!/usr/bin/env bash { a_output2=(); a_output3=() l_maxsize=\"1000\" # Maximum number of local interactive users before warning (Default 1,000) l_valid_shells=\"^($( awk -F\\/ '$NF != \"nologin\" {print}' /etc/shells | sed -rn '/^\\//{s,/,\\\\\\\\/,g;p}' | paste -s -d '|' - ))$\" a_user_and_home=() # Create array with local users and their home directories while read -r l_local_user l_local_user_home; do # Populate array with users and user home location [[ -n \"$l_local_user\" && -n \"$l_local_user_home\" ]] && a_user_and_home+=(\"$l_local_user:$l_local_user_home\") done <<< \"$(awk -v pat=\"$l_valid_shells\" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 \" \" $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd)\" l_asize=\"${#a_user_and_home[@]}\" # Here if we want to look at number of users before proceeding [ \"${#a_user_and_home[@]}\" -gt \"$l_maxsize\" ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" ** INFO **\" \\ \" - \\\"$l_asize\\\" Local interactive users found on the system\" \\ \" - This may be a long running check\" \"\" file_access_fix() { a_access_out=() l_max=\"$( printf '%o' $(( 0777 & ~$l_mask)) )\" if [ $(( $l_mode & $l_mask )) -gt 0 ]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" is mode: \\\"$l_mode\\\" and should be mode: \\\"$l_max\\\" or more restrictive\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be mode: \\\"$l_max\\\" or more restrictive\" chmod \"$l_change\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi if [[ ! \"$l_owner\" =~ ($l_user) ]]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" owned by: \\\"$l_owner\\\" and should be owned by \\\"${l_user//|/ or }\\\"\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be owned by \\\"${l_user//|/ or }\\\"\" chown \"$l_user\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi if [[ ! \"$l_gowner\" =~ ($l_group) ]]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" group owned by: \\\"$l_gowner\\\" and should be group owned by \\\"${l_group//|/ or }\\\"\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be group owned by \\\"${l_group//|/ or }\\\"\" chgrp \"$l_group\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi } while IFS=: read -r l_user l_home; do a_dot_file=(); a_netrc=(); a_netrc_warn=(); a_bhout=(); a_hdirout=() if [ -d \"$l_home\" ]; then l_group=\"$(id -gn \"$l_user\" | xargs)\";l_group=\"${l_group// /|}\" while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' l_hdfile; do while read -r l_mode l_owner l_gowner; do case \"$(basename \"$l_hdfile\")\" in .forward | .rhost ) a_dot_file+=(\" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" exists\" \" Please review and manually delete this file\") ;; .netrc ) l_mask='0177'; l_change=\"u-x,go-rwx\"; file_access_fix a_netrc_warn+=(\" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" exists\") ;; .bash_history ) l_mask='0177'; l_change=\"u-x,go-rwx\"; file_access_fix ;; * ) l_mask='0133'; l_change=\"u-x,go-wx\"; file_access_fix ;; esac done < <(stat -Lc '%#a %U %G' \"$l_hdfile\") done < <(find \"$l_home\" -xdev -type f -name '.*' -print0) fi [ \"${#a_dot_file[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && a_output2+=(\" - User: \\\"$l_user\\\" Home Directory: \\\"$l_home\\\"\" \"${a_dot_file[@]}\") [ \"${#a_netrc_warn[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && a_output3+=(\" - User: \\\"$l_user\\\" Home Directory: \\\"$l_home\\\"\" \"${a_netrc_warn[@]}\") done <<< \"$(printf '%s\\n' \"${a_user_and_home[@]}\")\" [ \"${#a_output3[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" ** WARNING **\" \"${a_output3[@]}\" \"\" [ \"${#a_output2[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \"${a_output2[@]}\" }."
