    title: "Install and configure HP-UX Secure Shell."
    description: "OpenSSH is a popular free distribution of the standards-track SSH protocols which allows secure encrypted network logins and file transfers. HP-UX Secure Shell is HP's pre-compiled and supported version of OpenSSH."
    rationale: "Common login and file transfer services such as telnet, FTP, rsh, rlogin, and rcp use insecure, clear-text protocols that are vulnerable to attack. OpenSSH provides a secure, encrypted replacement for these services. Security is improved by further constraining services in the default configuration."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to install and securely configure Secure Shell (SSH) 1. Download and install HP-UX Secure Shell if not already installed on the system. 2. Perform the following post-installation actions to secure the SSH service: a. Change to the /opt/ssh/etc directory b. Open sshd_config c. Set the Protocol token to 2. If it is absent, add and set it. d. Set the X11Forwarding token to yes. If it is absent, add and set it. e. Set the IgnoreRhosts token to yes. If it is absent, add and set it. f. Set the RhostsAuthentication token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. g. Set the RhostsRSAAuthentication token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. h. Set the PermitRootLogin token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. i. Set the PermitEmptyPasswords token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. j. Set the Banner token to /etc/issue. If it is absent, add and set it. k. Set root as the owner of sshd_config and ssh_config. l. Set sys as the group owner of sshd_config and ssh_config. m. Restrict write access to sshd_config and ssh_config to the file owner. The following script will perform the above procedure: 13 | P a g e cd /opt/ssh/etc cp -p sshd_config sshd_config.tmp awk '' /^Protocol/ /^IgnoreRhosts/ /^RhostsAuthentication/ /^RhostsRSAAuthentication/ { $2 ="no" }; /(^#|^)PermitRootLogin/    { $1 = "PermitRootLogin"; $2 = "no" }; /^PermitEmptyPasswords/    { $2 = "no" }; /^#Banner/                 { $1 = "Banner"; $2 = "/etc/issue" } { print }'' sshd_config.tmp > sshd_config { $2 ="2"}; { $2 = "yes" }; { $2 = "no" }; rm -f sshd_config.tmp chown root:sys ssh_config sshd_config chmod go-w ssh_config sshd_config'

    title: "Disable Standard Services."
    description: "The stock /etc/inetd.conf file shipped with HP-UX contains many services which are rarely used, or which have more secure alternatives. Indeed, after enabling SSH (see item 1.1.2) it may be possible to completely do away with all inetd-based services, since SSH provides both a secure login mechanism and a means of transferring files to and from the system. The steps articulated in the Remediation section will disable all services normally enabled in the HP-UX inetd.conf file. The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services—in particular, the services that are disabled in the last two loops in the Action section below."
    rationale: "The stock /etc/inetd.conf file shipped with HP-UX contains services that are rarely used or have more secure alternatives. Removing these from inetd will avoid exposure to possible security vulnerability in those services."

    description: "Re-enable telnet. Telnet uses an unencrypted network protocol, which means data from the login session (such as passwords and all other data transmitted during the session) can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network, and also that the session can be hijacked by outsiders to gain access to the remote system. HP-UX Secure Shell (OpenSSH) provides an encrypted alternative to telnet (and other utilities) and should be used instead."
    rationale: "There is a mission-critical reason that requires users to access the system via telnet instead of the more secure SSH protocol."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to re-enable telnet: 1. Open /etc/inetd.conf. 2. Delete the comment character (#) from the telnet service definition. 3.

    description: "Re-enable ftp. Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the FTP session itself can be hijacked by an external attacker. SSH provides two alternative, encrypted file transfer mechanisms, scp and sftp, which should be used instead of FTP. Even if FTP is required because the local system is an anonymous FTP server, consider requiring authenticated users on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. For further information on restricting FTP access to the system, see item 1.6.2 below. Sites may also consider augmenting the 'ftpd -l' below with '-v' (10.x and 11.x) or '-L' (11.x only) for additional logging of FTP transactions, or with '-a' (11.x only) for fine grain FTP access control through the use of a configuration file - see the ftpd(1M) man page on your systems for details."

Variables are merely set (rather than renaming or removing startup scripts) so that the local administrator can easily "restore" any of these services if they discover a mission-critical need to have it. Additionally, HP-UX patches tend to supply fresh copies of the startup scripts, so they may get inadvertently re- enabled, whereas setting configuration variables usually survives patch installs. Finally, setting configuration variables is the method recommended and supported by HP. Note that not all of the configuration files listed above will exist on all systems (some are only valid for certain releases, others only exist if certain OEM vendor software is installed). The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services - in particular, the services that are disabled in the second block of the remediation section below. Rather than disabling and then re-enabling these services, experienced administrators may wish to simply disable only those services that they know are unnecessary for their systems. Note: that HP-UX 11.31 was the first version to support disablement of the NFS core services.

Clearly there is no need to run the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. If the system is an NFS server, the admin should take reasonable precautions when exporting file systems, including restricting NFS access to a specific range of local IP addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" and "nosuid" where appropriate. For more information consult the exportfs(1M) manual page. Much higher levels of security can be achieved by combining NFS with secure RPC or Kerberos, although there is significant administrative overhead involved in this transition. Note that since this service uses ONC RPC mechanisms, it is important that the system''s RPC portmapper (rpcbind) also be enabled when this service is turned on. For more information see Item 1.3.12 below. Also, note that some releases of Oracle software for HP-UX require NFS services in order to install properly. Therefore, the NFS server process may need to be started by hand on systems on which Oracle software is to be installed/updated. This can be accomplished by performing the following: 1. Temporarily set NFS_SERVER=1, /etc/rc.config.d/nfsconf 2. Execute:  /sbin/init.d/nfs.core start /sbin/init.d/nfs.server start 3. Install Oracle 4.

HP-UX does not use these markers, but they may exist in files that have been imported from other platforms. They should be deleted if they exist."

    rationale: "Restricting access to files and directories created by a user from any other user on the system reduces the possibility of an unauthorized account accessing that user's files. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command.

    description: "The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed prior to the login prompt on the system's console and serial devices, as well as for remote terminal-session logins such as through SSH or Telnet.  /etc/motd is generally displayed after all successful logins, no matter where the user is logging in from, but is thought to be less useful because it only provides notification to the user after the machine has been accessed."
    rationale: "Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.
