    title: "Install and configure HP-UX Secure Shell."
    description: "OpenSSH is a popular free distribution of the standards-track SSH protocols which allows secure encrypted network logins and file transfers. HP-UX Secure Shell is HP's pre-compiled and supported version of OpenSSH."
    rationale: "Common login and file transfer services such as telnet, FTP, rsh, rlogin, and rcp use insecure, clear-text protocols that are vulnerable to attack. OpenSSH provides a secure, encrypted replacement for these services. Security is improved by further constraining services in the default configuration."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to install and securely configure Secure Shell (SSH) 1. Download and install HP-UX Secure Shell if not already installed on the system. 2. Perform the following post-installation actions to secure the SSH service: a. Change to the /opt/ssh/etc directory b. Open sshd_config c. Set the Protocol token to 2. If it is absent, add and set it. d. Set the X11Forwarding token to yes. If it is absent, add and set it. e. Set the IgnoreRhosts token to yes. If it is absent, add and set it. f. Set the RhostsAuthentication token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. g. Set the RhostsRSAAuthentication token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. h. Set the PermitRootLogin token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. i. Set the PermitEmptyPasswords token to no. If it is absent, add and set it. j. Set the Banner token to /etc/issue. If it is absent, add and set it. k. Set root as the owner of sshd_config and ssh_config. l. Set sys as the group owner of sshd_config and ssh_config. m. Restrict write access to sshd_config and ssh_config to the file owner. The following script will perform the above procedure: 13 | P a g e cd /opt/ssh/etc cp -p sshd_config sshd_config.tmp awk '' /^Protocol/ /^IgnoreRhosts/ /^RhostsAuthentication/ /^RhostsRSAAuthentication/ { $2 ="no" }; /(^#|^)PermitRootLogin/    { $1 = "PermitRootLogin"; $2 = "no" }; /^PermitEmptyPasswords/    { $2 = "no" }; /^#Banner/                 { $1 = "Banner"; $2 = "/etc/issue" } { print }'' sshd_config.tmp > sshd_config { $2 ="2"}; { $2 = "yes" }; { $2 = "no" }; rm -f sshd_config.tmp chown root:sys ssh_config sshd_config chmod go-w ssh_config sshd_config'

    title: "Disable Standard Services."
    description: "The stock /etc/inetd.conf file shipped with HP-UX contains many services which are rarely used, or which have more secure alternatives. Indeed, after enabling SSH (see item 1.1.2) it may be possible to completely do away with all inetd-based services, since SSH provides both a secure login mechanism and a means of transferring files to and from the system. The steps articulated in the Remediation section will disable all services normally enabled in the HP-UX inetd.conf file. The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services—in particular, the services that are disabled in the last two loops in the Action section below."
    rationale: "The stock /etc/inetd.conf file shipped with HP-UX contains services that are rarely used or have more secure alternatives. Removing these from inetd will avoid exposure to possible security vulnerability in those services."

    description: "Re-enable telnet. Telnet uses an unencrypted network protocol, which means data from the login session (such as passwords and all other data transmitted during the session) can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network, and also that the session can be hijacked by outsiders to gain access to the remote system. HP-UX Secure Shell (OpenSSH) provides an encrypted alternative to telnet (and other utilities) and should be used instead."

Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the FTP session itself can be hijacked by an external attacker. SSH provides two alternative, encrypted file transfer mechanisms, scp and sftp, which should be used instead of FTP. Even if FTP is required because the local system is an anonymous FTP server, consider requiring authenticated users on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. For further information on restricting FTP access to the system, see item 1.6.2 below. Sites may also consider augmenting the 'ftpd -l' below with '-v' (10.x and 11.x) or '-L' (11.x only) for additional logging of FTP transactions, or with '-a' (11.x only) for fine grain FTP access control through the use of a configuration file - see the ftpd(1M) man page on your systems for details."

Finally, setting configuration variables is the method recommended and supported by HP. Note that not all of the configuration files listed above will exist on all systems (some are only valid for certain releases, others only exist if certain OEM vendor software is installed). The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services - in particular, the services that are disabled in the second block of the remediation section below. Rather than disabling and then re-enabling these services, experienced administrators may wish to simply disable only those services that they know are unnecessary for their systems.

    description: 'Re-enable the NFS file service. NFS is frequently exploited to gain unauthorized access to files and systems. Clearly there is no need to run the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. If the system is an NFS server, the admin should take reasonable precautions when exporting file systems, including restricting NFS access to a specific range of local IP addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" and "nosuid" where appropriate. For more information consult the exportfs(1M) manual page. Much higher levels of security can be achieved by combining NFS with secure RPC or Kerberos, although there is significant administrative overhead involved in this transition. Note that since this service uses ONC RPC mechanisms, it is important that the system''s RPC portmapper (rpcbind) also be enabled when this service is turned on. For more information see Item 1.3.12 below. Also, note that some releases of Oracle software for HP-UX require NFS services in order to install properly. Therefore, the NFS server process may need to be started by hand on systems on which Oracle software is to be installed/updated. This can be accomplished by performing the following: 1. Temporarily set NFS_SERVER=1, /etc/rc.config.d/nfsconf 2. Execute:  /sbin/init.d/nfs.core start /sbin/init.d/nfs.server start 3. Install Oracle 4.

    description: "The commands below will set all active accounts (except the root account) to force password changes every 90 days (91 days when not running in HP-UX Trusted Mode) and then prevent password changes for seven days (one week) thereafter. Users will begin receiving warnings 30 days (28 days when not running in HP-UX Trusted Mode) before their password expires. Sites also have the option of expiring idle accounts after a certain number of days (see the on-line manual page for the usermod command, particularly the -f option). These are recommended starting values, but sites may choose to make them more restrictive depending on local policies."
    rationale: "It is a good idea to force users to change passwords on a regular basis."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to set password expiration parameters on all active accounts: 1. Identify all user accounts excluding root that are not locked, and for each: 2. Set password expiration parameters for the account (logname) by executing the following: passwd -x 91 -n 7 -w 28 <logname> for trusted systems, perform the following: /usr/lbin/modprpw -m exptm=90,mintm=7,expwarn=30 <logname> 3. Set the default account expiration parameters by appending the following lines to /etc/default/security: a. PASSWORD_MAXDAYS=91 b. PASSWORD_MINDAYS=7 c. PASSWORD_WARNDAYS=28 4. Set the default parameters for trusted systems with: /usr/lbin/modprdef -m exptm=90,mintm=7,expwarn=30 The following script will perform the procedure above. logins -ox \ | awk -F: ''($8 != "LK" && $1 != "root") { print $1 }'' \ | while read logname; do passwd -x 91 -n 7 -w 28 "$logname" /usr/lbin/modprpw -m exptm=90,mintm=7,expwarn=30 \ "$logname" done echo PASSWORD_MAXDAYS=91 >> /etc/default/security echo PASSWORD_MINDAYS=7 >> /etc/default/security echo PASSWORD_WARNDAYS=28 >> /etc/default/security /usr/lbin/modprdef -m exptm=90,mintm=7,expwarn=30'

    title: "Set strong password enforcement policies."
    description: "The policies set here are designed to force users to make better password choices when changing their passwords. Sites often have differing opinions on the optimal value of the MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH and PASSWORD_HISTORY_DEPTH parameters. A minimum password length of seven is in line with industry standards, especially the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standard; however, a longer value may be warranted if account locks are not enabled (item 1.6.10). A password history depth of ten combined with passwords that expire four times per year (item 1.8.3) means users will typically not re-use the same password in any given year. Requiring an upper/lowercase and special character password will dramatically increase the password search space and lower the chances for brute-force attack significantly. - Note: these settings are known to exist for HP-UX 11iv2, 0512 and later. The man page for security(5) will indicate if these exist on your particular system. Be sure to consult you local security standards before adopting the values given above."
    rationale: "All users should use strong passwords."
    remediation: "Perform the following to set strong password enforcement policies: 1. Change the following parameters in the /etc/default/security file to establish default password policies for new users: a. MIN_PASSORD_LENGTH=7 b. PASSWORD_HISTORY_DEPTH=10 c. PASSWORD_MIN_UPPER_CASE_CHARS=1 d. PASSWORD_MIN_DIGIT_CHARS=1 e. PASSWORD_MIN_SPECIAL_CHARS=1 f. PASSWORD_MIN_LOWER_CASE_CHARS=1 2. If using a trusted system, issue the following modprdef commands to disallow null or trivial passwords:  modprdef -m nullpw=NO modprdef -m rstrpw=YES The following script will perform the procedure above: modprdef -m nullpw=NO modprdef -m rstrpw=YES ch_rc -a -p MIN_PASSORD_LENGTH=7 /etc/default/security ch_rc -a -p PASSWORD_HISTORY_DEPTH=10 \ /etc/default/security ch_rc -a -p PASSWORD_MIN_UPPER_CASE_CHARS=1 \ /etc/default/security ch_rc -a -p PASSWORD_MIN_DIGIT_CHARS=1 \ /etc/default/security ch_rc -a -p PASSWORD_MIN_SPECIAL_CHARS=1 \ /etc/default/security ch_rc -a -p PASSWORD_MIN_LOWER_CASE_CHARS=1 \ /etc/default/security modprdef -m nullpw=NO modprdef -m rstrpw=YES"

    title: "Set default umask for users."
    description: "Set the default umask to 077 so that files created by users will not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system. - Bastille Note: sets the default umask, but uses a umask of 027 rather than the 077."
    rationale: "Restricting access to files and directories created by a user from any other user on the system reduces the possibility of an unauthorized account accessing that user's files. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask by inserting the umask command into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.) in their home directories."

    description: "The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed prior to the login prompt on the system's console and serial devices, as well as for remote terminal-session logins such as through SSH or Telnet. /etc/motd is generally displayed after all successful logins, no matter where the user is logging in from, but is thought to be less useful because it only provides notification to the user after the machine has been accessed."
    rationale: "Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of trespassers on the computer system.
