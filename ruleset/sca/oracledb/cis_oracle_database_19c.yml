This  setting should  have  a value of  LOG unless the  organization  has a compelling  reason  to  use a different value because LOG should  cause the necessary information to  be  logged.

    description: "Enabling  this  audit option  will  cause auditing  of  all attempts  to  connect to  the database, whether successful  or  not,  as  well  as  audit session disconnects/logoffs.  The commands  to audit  SESSION,  CONNECT or  CREATE SESSION all  accomplish  the same  thing - they  initiate statement  auditing  of  the connect statement used  to  create  a database  session."
    rationale: "Auditing  attempts  to  connect to  the database  is  basic and mandated  by  most  security initiatives. Any attempt to  logon to  a locked  account,  failed  attempts  to  logon to  default accounts  or  an  unusually high  number  of  failed  logon attempts  of  any sort, for any user, in  a particular  time  period  may indicate  an  intrusion attempt.  In  forensics,  the logon record may  be  first in  a chain of  evidence  and contain information found in  no  other type  of  audit record  for the session.  Logon and logoff  in  the audit trail define  the period  and duration  of the  session."

  # 6.2.27 Ensure the 'LOGON' AND 'LOGOFF' Actions Audit Is Enabled
  - id: 24605
    title: "Ensure the 'LOGON' AND 'LOGOFF' Actions Audit Is Enabled."
    description: "Oracle  database  users log on  to  the database  to  perform their work. Enabling  this  unified audit causes  logging of  all LOGON actions,  whether successful  or  unsuccessful, issued  by  the users regardless  of  the privileges  held  by  the users to  log into  the database. In  addition, LOGOFF action audit captures  logoff  activities. This  audit action  also  captures  logon/logoff  to the  open  database  by  SYSDBA and  SYSOPER."
    rationale: "Logging and monitoring  of  all attempts  to  logon to  the database, whether successful  or unsuccessful,  may provide forensic  evidence  about potential suspicious/unauthorized activities. Any such  activities  may be  a cause for further investigation.  In  addition, organization  security  policies  and industry/government regulations may require logging of all  user  activities  involving LOGON and LOGOFF."
    remediation: "ALTER AUDIT POLICY CIS_UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICY ADD ACTIONS LOGON, LOGOFF;"
