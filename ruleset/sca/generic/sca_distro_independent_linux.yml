  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured. (Scored)
  - id: 36008
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utalizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl unmask tmp.mount systemctl enable tmp.mount Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,noexec,nodev,nosuid."

In addition, making /var/tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /var/tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/tmp . For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."
    rationale: "Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system."
    remediation: "On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios. Notes: Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your hardware."

    description: 'systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group "systemd-timesync" needs to be created on installation of systemd. This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system.'

In cases where a value-added firewall is not provided by a distribution, TCP Wrappers provides a simple access list and standardized logging method for services capable of supporting it. Services that are called from inetd and xinetd support the use of TCP wrappers. Any service that can support TCP wrappers will have the libwrap.so library attached to it."
    rationale: "TCP Wrappers provide a good simple access list mechanism to services that may not have that support built in. It is recommended that all services that can support TCP Wrappers, use it."
    remediation: "Run the following command to install TCP Wrappers: # yum install tcp_wrappers # apt-get install tcpd # zypper install tcpd."

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user."
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

    title: "Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is collected."
    description: 'Monitor scope changes for system administrations. If the system has been properly configured to force system administrators to log in as themselves first and then use the sudo command to execute privileged commands, it is possible to monitor changes in scope. The file /etc/sudoers will be written to when the file or its attributes have changed. The audit records will be tagged with the identifier "scope.".'

    description: 'Monitor the loading and unloading of kernel modules.

    title: "Ensure only strong Ciphers are used."
    description: "This variable limits the ciphers that SSH can use during communication."
    rationale: 'Weak ciphers that are used for authentication to the cryptographic module cannot be relied upon to provide confidentiality or integrity, and system data may be compromised The DES, Triple DES, and Blowfish ciphers, as used in SSH, have a birthday bound of approximately four billion blocks, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain cleartext data via a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a "Sweet32" attack The RC4 algorithm, as used in the TLS protocol and SSL protocol, does not properly combine state data with key data during the initialization phase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct plaintext-recovery attacks against the initial bytes of a stream by sniffing network traffic that occasionally relies on keys affected by the Invariance Weakness, and then using a brute-force approach involving LSB values, aka the "Bar Mitzvah" issue The passwords used during an SSH session encrypted with RC4 can be recovered by an attacker who is able to capture and replay the session Error handling in the SSH protocol; Client and Server, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address.'

  # 5.2.16 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Scored)
  - id: 36153
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening.. While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy. The recommended setting for ClientAliveCountMax is 0. In this case, the client session will be terminated after 5 minutes of idle time and no keepalive messages will be sent."

    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications. Default Value: AllowTcpForwarding yes."

It performs checks such as making sure a password is not a dictionary word, it is a certain length, contains a mix of characters (e.g. alphabet, numeric, other) and more. The following are definitions of the pam_cracklib.so options. - try_first_pass - retrieve the password from a previous stacked PAM module. If not available, then prompt the user for a password. - retry=3 - Allow 3 tries before sending back a failure. - minlen=14 - password must be 14 characters or more - dcredit=-1 - provide at least one digit - ucredit=-1 - provide at least one uppercase character - ocredit=-1 - provide at least one special character - lcredit=-1 - provide at least one lowercase character The pam_pwquality.so module functions similarly but the minlen , dcredit , ucredit , ocredit , and lcredit parameters are stored in the /etc/security/pwquality.conf file. The settings shown above are one possible policy. Alter these values to conform to your own organization's password policies."

    title: "Ensure default group for the root account is GID 0."
    description: "The usermod command can be used to specify which group the root user belongs to. This affects permissions of files that are created by the root user."

    title: "Ensure access to the su command is restricted."
    description: "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo , which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su , the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su."
    rationale: "Restricting the use of su , and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo , whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."

    rationale: "Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts."
