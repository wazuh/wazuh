    title: "Ensure Software Update Deferment Is Less Than or Equal to 30 Days."
    description: "Apple provides the capability to manage software updates on Apple devices through mobile device management. Part of those capabilities permit organizations to defer software updates and allow for testing. Many organizations have specialized software and configurations that may be negatively impacted by Apple updates. If software updates are deferred, they should not be deferred for more than 30 days. This control only verifies that deferred software updates are not deferred for more than 30 days."

    title: "Ensure Firewall Is Enabled."
    description: "A firewall is a piece of software that blocks unwanted incoming connections to a system. The socketfilter Firewall is what is used when the Firewall is turned on in the Security & Privacy Preference Pane. Logging is required to appropriately monitor what access is allowed and denied. The logs can be viewed in the macOS Unified Logs. In previous versions of macOS (prior to macOS 15 Sequoia) there was an additional step to turn on firewall logging after enabling the firewall. As of macOS 15 logging is turned on automatically without user interaction. The logging recommendation has been removed in the macOS 15 benchmark and will not be included going forward. If your organization is looking for more detailed information about network security, you will need a third-party solution."
    rationale: "A firewall minimizes the threat of unauthorized users gaining access to your system while connected to a network or the Internet."

This control aligns with the primary macOS use case of a laptop that is often connected to untrusted networks where host segregation may be non-existent.

    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates, and log entries. Note: If your organization has internal time servers, enter them here. Enterprise mobile devices may need to use a mix of internal and external time servers. If multiple servers are required, use the Date & Time System Preference with each server separated by a space. Additional Note: The default Apple time server is time.apple.com. Variations include time.euro.apple.com. While it is certainly more efficient to use internal time servers, there is no reason to block access to global Apple time servers or to add a time.apple.com alias to internal DNS records. There are no reports that Apple gathers any information from NTP synchronization, as the computers already phone home to Apple for Apple services including iCloud use and software updates. Best practice is to allow DNS resolution to an authoritative time service for time.apple.com, preferably to connect to Apple servers, but local servers are acceptable as well."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features."

    description: "Screen Sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer's screen. While sharing the computer's screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer. While mature administration and management does not use graphical connections for standard maintenance, most help desks have capabilities to assist users in performing their work when they have technical issues and need support. Help desks use graphical remote tools to understand what the user sees and assist them so they can get back to work. For MacOS, some of these remote capabilities can use Apple's OS tools. Control is therefore not meant to prohibit the use of a just-in-time graphical view from authorized personnel with authentication controls. Sharing should not be enabled except in narrow windows when help desk support is required. Screen Sharing on macOS can allow the use of the insecure VNC protocol. VNC is a clear text protocol that should not be used on macOS."
    rationale: "Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer."

    description: "File sharing from a user workstation creates additional risks, such as: - Open ports are created that can be probed and attacked - Passwords are attached to user accounts for access that may be exposed and endanger other parts of the organizational environment, including directory accounts - Increased complexity makes security more difficult and may expose additional attack vectors Apple's File Sharing uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to share to other computers that can mount SMB shares. This includes other macOS computers. Apple warns that SMB sharing stored passwords is less secure, and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user accessing the Mac must have SMB enabled.

    description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
    rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."
    impact: "The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts. For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered: - Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out. - Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server. - Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark."

This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity and bandwidth, user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data. Content types supported by Content Caching in macOS."
    rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases, organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."
    impact: "This setting will adversely affect bandwidth usage between local subnets and the Internet."

    title: "Ensure Time Machine Volumes Are Encrypted If Time Machine Is Enabled."
    description: "One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place, it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not, it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique, complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use. While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult, backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes."
    rationale: "Backup volumes need to be encrypted."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to enable encryption on the Time Machine drive: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select General 3. Select Time Machine 4. Select the unencrypted drive 5. Select - to forget that drive as a destination 6. Select + to add a different drive as the destination 7. Select Set Up Disk... 8. Set Encrypt Backup to enabled 9. Enter a password in the New Password and the same password in the Re-enter Password fields 10. A password hint is required, but it is recommended that you do not use any identifying information for the password Note: In macOS 12.0 Monterey and previous, the existing Time Machine drive could have encryption added without formatting it. This is no longer possible in macOS 13.0 Ventura. If you wish to keep previous backups from the unencrypted volume, you will need to manually move those files over to the new encrypted drive."

    title: "Ensure Power Nap Is Disabled for Intel Macs."
    description: "Power Nap allows the system to stay in low power mode, especially while on battery power, and periodically connect to previously known networks with stored credentials for user applications to phone home and get updates. This capability requires FileVault to remain unlocked and the use of previously joined networks to be risk accepted based on the SSID without user input. This control has been updated to check the status on both battery and AC Power. The presence of an electrical outlet does not completely correlate with logical and physical security of the device or available networks."
    rationale: "Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access. The use of Power Nap adds to the risk of compromised physical and logical security. The user should be able to decrypt FileVault and have the applications download what is required when the computer is actively used. The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs."
    impact: "Power Nap exists for unattended user application updates like email and social media clients. With Power Nap disabled, the computer will not wake and reconnect to known wireless SSIDs intermittently when slept."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to disable Power Nap: Desktop Instructions: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select Energy Saver 3. Set Power Nap to disabled 4. Select UPS (if applicable) 5. Set Power Nap to disabled Laptop Instructions: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select Battery 3. Select Power Adapter (for laptops only) 4. Set Power Nap to disabled 5. Select Battery 6. Set Power Nap to disabled 7. Select UPS (if applicable) 8.

    description: "This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls. This feature allows other users to be able to access your computer's shared resources, such as shared printers or Apple Music playlists, even when your computer is in sleep mode. In a closed network when only authorized devices could wake a computer, it could be valuable to wake computers in order to do management push activity. Where mobile workstations and agents exist, the device will more likely check in to receive updates when already awake. Mobile devices should not be listening for signals on any unmanaged network or where untrusted devices exist that could send wake signals."

    description: "Auditing is the capture and maintenance of information about security-related events. Auditable events often depend on differing organizational requirements."
    rationale: "Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements. The flags selected below may not adequately meet organizational requirements for users of this benchmark. The auditing checks for the flags proposed here will not impact additional flags that are selected."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to set the required Security Auditing Flags: Edit the /etc/security/audit_control file and add -fm, ad, -ex, aa, -fr, lo, and -fw to flags. You can also substitute -all for -fm, -ex, -fr, and -fw."

    title: "Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size."
    description: 'macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization. The default value has an "all_max" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention, and a less precise rotation argument. The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year, and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year. While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag, the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired. Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information. man asl.conf - The maximum file size limitation string should be removed "all_max=" - An organization appropriate retention should be added "ttl=" - The rotation should be set with timestamps "rotate=utc" or "rotate=local".'
    rationale: "Archiving and retaining install.log for at least a year is beneficial in the event of an incident as it will allow the user to view the various changes to the system along with the date and time they occurred."
    impact: "Without log files system maintenance and security forensics cannot be properly performed."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to ensure that install logs are retained for at least 365 days: Edit the /etc/asl/com.apple.install file and add or modify the ttl value to 365 or greater on the file line. Also, remove the all_max= setting and value from the file line."

    rationale: 'Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour''s multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack.

This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed.'

  # 5.1.4 Ensure Signed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled. (Automated)
  - id: 35045
    title: "Ensure Signed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled."
    description: "Signed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur. During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume. The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system. During read operations for files located in the Signed System Volume, a hash is calculated and compared to the value stored in the Merkle tree."
    rationale: "Running without Signed System Volume on a production system could run the risk of Apple software that integrates directly with macOS being modified."
    impact: "Apple Software that integrates with the operating system could become compromised."
    remediation: "If SSV has been disabled, assume that the operating system has been compromised. Back up any files, and do a clean install to a known good Operating System."

This control, along with the control to use a separate timestamp for each tty, limits the window where an unauthorized user, process, or attacker could utilize legitimate credentials that are valid for longer than required."
    rationale: "The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable.

Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period.

    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to edit the sudo settings: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<configuration file name> example: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/10_cissudoconfiguration Note: Unlike other Unix and/or Linux distros, macOS will ignore configuration files in the sudoers.d folder that contain a . so do not add a file extension to the configuration file. Add the line Defaults timestamp_type=tty to the configuration file. Note: The Defaults timestamp_type=tty line can be added to an existing configuration file or a new one. That will depend on your organization's preference and works either way."

  # 5.6 Ensure the "root" Account Is Disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 35056
    title: "Ensure the 'root' Account Is Disabled."
    description: "The root account is a superuser account that has access privileges to perform any actions and read/write to any file on the computer. With some versions of Linux, the system administrator may commonly use the root account to perform administrative functions."
    rationale: "Enabling and using the root account puts the system at risk since any successful exploit or mistake while the root account is in use could have unlimited access privileges within the system. Using the sudo command allows users to perform functions as a root user while limiting and password protecting the access privileges. By default the root account is not enabled on a macOS computer. An administrator can escalate privileges using the sudo command (use -s or -i to get a root shell)."
    impact: "Some legacy POSIX software might expect an available root account."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to ensure that the root user is disabled: 1. Open /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications/Directory Utility 2. Click the lock icon to unlock the service 3. Click Edit in the menu bar 4. Click Disable Root User Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable the root user: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/dsenableroot -d username = root user password: Run the following command to disable the root user shell: % /usr/bin/dscl . -create /Users/root UserShell /usr/bin/false."

    title: "Ensure an Administrator Account Cannot Login to Another User's Active and Locked Session."
    description: "macOS has a privilege that can be granted to any user that will allow that user to unlock active user's sessions."
    rationale: "Disabling the administrator's and/or user's ability to log into another user's active and locked session prevents unauthorized persons from viewing potentially sensitive and/or personal information."
    impact: "While Fast user switching is a workaround for some lab environments, especially where there is even less of an expectation of privacy, this setting change may impact some maintenance workflows."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable a user logging into another user's active and/or locked session: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/security authorizationdb write system.login.screensaver authenticate-session-owner YES (0). Running this command will disable Touch ID to unlock the screen saver.

  # 5.8 Ensure a Login Window Banner Exists. (Automated)
  - id: 35058
    title: "Ensure a Login Window Banner Exists."
    description: "A Login window banner warning informs the user that the system is reserved for authorized use only. It enforces an acknowledgment by the user that they have been informed of the use policy in the banner if required. The system recognizes either the .txt and the .rtf formats."
    rationale: "An access warning may reduce a casual attacker's tendency to target the system. Access warnings may also aid in the prosecution of an attacker by evincing the attacker's knowledge of the system's private status, acceptable use policy, and authorization requirements."
    impact: "Users will have to click on the window with the Login text before logging into the computer."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following commands to create or edit the login window text and set the proper permissions: Edit (or create) a PolicyBanner.txt or PolicyBanner.rtf file, in the /Library/Security/ folder, to include the required login window banner text. Perform the following to set permissions on the policy banner file: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown o+r /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.txt $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown o+r /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtf Note: If your organization uses an .rtfd file to set the policy banner, run $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown -R o+rx /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtfd to update the permissions."

  # 5.9 Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist. (Automated)
  - id: 35059
    title: "Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist."
    description: "In the previous two controls, the guest account login has been disabled and sharing to guests has been disabled, as well. There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed, you have the option to archive it, leave it in place, or delete. In the case of the guest folder, the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed, it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders, as well. Rather than ignoring the folder's continued existence, it is best removed."
    rationale: "The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately."
    impact: "The Guest account should not be necessary after it is disabled, and it will be automatically re-created if the Guest account is re-enabled."

The native Apple provisioned tool looks for specific known malware is completely integrated into the OS. No matter what other tools are being used XProtect should have the latest signatures available."
    rationale: "Apple creates signatures for known malware that actually effects Macs and that knowledge should be leveraged."
