  # 2.1.1 Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist (Automated)
  - id: 18006
    title: "Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist."
    description: "Bluetooth devices use a wireless communications system that replaces the cables used by other peripherals to connect to a system. It is by design a peer-to-peer network technology and typically lacks centralized administration and security enforcement infrastructure."
    rationale: "Bluetooth is particularly susceptible to a diverse set of security vulnerabilities involving identity detection, location tracking, denial of service, unintended control and access of data and voice channels, and unauthorized device control and data access."
    remediation: "Open a terminal session and enter the following command to disable bluetooth: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0 && sudo killall -HUP blued"

  - id: 18008
    title: "Enable Set time and date automatically."
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes.  This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features."
    remediation: "Run the following commands: sudo systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver <timeserver>    sudo systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on"

    title: "Ensure time set is within appropriate limits."
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds, for this audit a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time this check is not strict, it may be too great for your organization, adjust to a smaller offset value as needed. Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to ensure your time is set within an appropriate limit: sudo systemsetup -getnetworktimeserver -> Get the time server name and then run: sudo touch /var/db/ntp-kod && sudo chown root:wheel /var/db/ntp-kod && sudo sntp -sS <YOUR-TIME-SERVER> "

  # 2.3.1 Set an inactivity interval of 20 minutes or less for the screen saver (Automated)
  - id: 18010
    title: "Set an inactivity interval of 20 minutes or less for the screen saver."
    description: "A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS the screensaver starts after a value selected in a drop down menu, 10 minutes and 20 minutes are both options and either is acceptable. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts."
    rationale: "Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time."
    remediation: "Run the following command to verify that the idle time of the screen saver to 20 minutes or less (≤1200): sudo defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int 600 "

  - id: 18011
    title: "Secure screen saver corners."
    description: "Hot Corners can be configured to disable the screen saver by moving the mouse cursor to a corner of the screen."
    rationale: "Setting a hot corner to disable the screen saver poses a potential security risk since an unauthorized person could use this to bypass the login screen and gain access to the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command to turn off Disable Screen Saver for a Hot Corner: sudo -u <username> defaults write com.apple.dock <corner that is set to '6'> -int 0 "

    title: "Disable Screen Sharing."
    description: "Screen sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer's screen. While sharing the computer's screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer."
    rationale: "Disabling screen sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer."
    remediation: "Run the following command to turn off Screen Sharing: sudo launchctl disable system/com.apple.screensharing"

  # 2.4.5 Disable Remote Login (Automated)
  - id: 18016
    title: "Disable Remote Login."
    description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
    rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."

The screen sharing options in Remote Management are identical to those in the Screen Sharing section. In fact, only one of the two can be configured. If Remote Management is used, refer to the Screen Sharing section above on issues regard screen sharing. Remote Management should only be enabled when a Directory is in place to manage the accounts with access. Computers will be available on port 5900 on a macOS System and could accept connections from untrusted hosts depending on the configuration, definitely a concern for mobile systems."
    rationale: "Remote management should only be enabled on trusted networks with strong user controls present in a Directory system. Mobile devices without strict controls are vulnerable to exploit and monitoring."

  # 2.4.10 Disable Content Caching (Automated)
  - id: 18021
    title: "Disable Content Caching."
    description: "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data."
    rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk they add to the management complexity, since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."

    description: "Starting with macOS 10.15 Apple has provided a control to allow a user to share Apple downloaded content on all Apple devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID. This allows a user to share downloaded Movies, Music or TV shows with other controlled macOS, iOS and iPadOS devices as well as photos with Apple TVs. With this capability guest users can also use media downloaded on the computer. Best practice is not to use the computer as a server but to utilize Apple's cloud storage to download and use content stored there if content stored with Apple is used on multiple devices."
