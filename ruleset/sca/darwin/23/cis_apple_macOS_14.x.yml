  # 1.1 Ensure All Apple-provided Software Is Current. (Automated)
   - id: 18500
     title: "Ensure All Apple-provided Software Is Current."
     description: "Software vendors release security patches and software updates for their products when security vulnerabilities are discovered. There is no simple way to complete this action without a network connection to an Apple software repository. Please ensure appropriate access for this control. This check is only for what Apple provides through software update. Software updates should be run at minimum every 30 days. Run the following command to verify when software update was previously run: $ /usr/bin/sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate | grep -e LastFullSuccessfulDate. The response should be in the last 30 days (Example): LastFullSuccessfulDate = \"2020-07-30 12:45:25 +0000\";."
     rationale: "It is important that these updates be applied in a timely manner to prevent unauthorized persons from exploiting the identified vulnerabilities."
     impact: "Installation of updates can be disruptive to the users especially if an restart is required. Major updates need to be applied after creating an organizational patch policy. It is also advised to run updates and forced restarts during system downtime and not while in active use."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following to install all available software updates: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select General 3. Select Software Update 4. Select Update All Terminal Method: Run the following command to verify what packages need to be installed: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -l The output will include the following: Software Update found the following new or updated software: Run the following command to install all the packages that need to be updated: To install all updates run the command: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i -a Or run the following command to install individual packages: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i '<package name>' Note: If one of the software updates listed includes Action: restart, then you must attach the -R flag to force a system restart. If the system update is complete but no restart occurs, then the system is in an unknown state that requires a future restart. It is advised to run updates and forced restarts during system downtime and not while in active use. example: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -l Software Update Tool Finding available software Software Update found the following new or updated software: * Label: ProVideoFormats-2.2.7 Title: Pro Video Formats, Version: 2.2.7, Size: 9693KiB, Recommended: YES, * Label: Command Line Tools for Xcode-15.0 Title: Command Line Tools for Xcode, Version: 15.0, Size: 721962KiB, Recommended: YES, $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i 'ProVideoFormats-2.2.7' Software Update Tool Finding available software Attempting to quit apps: ( \"com.apple.Compressor\" ) Waiting for user to quit any relevant apps Successfully quit all apps Downloaded Pro Video Formats Installing Pro Video Formats Done with Pro Video Formats Done. In the above example, if a restart was required, the command to remediate would be /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i 'ProVideoFormats-2.2.7' -R."

     title: "Ensure the System is Managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) Software."
     description: "Apple provides the capability to manage macOS, iOS and iPadOS using Mobile Device Management (MDM). Profiles are used to configure devices to enforce security controls as well as to configure the devices for authorized access. Many security controls available on Apple devices are only available through the use of profile settings using MDM. This capability is also misused by attackers who have added rogue profiles to the list of unwanted software and fake software updates to induce users to approve the installation of malicious content. Organizations should have Mobile Device management software in place to harden organizationally managed devices and take advantage of additional Apple controls as well as to make the devices more resistant to attackers enticing users to install unwanted content from rogue MDMs."
     rationale: "Mobile Device Management is the preferred Apple method to manage Apple devices. Some capability in this technology is a requirement for the enforcement of some controls. Users with managed devices should be trained and familiar with authrized content provided through the organizations' MDM."
     impact: "An MDM is yet another additional tool that requires technically adept personnel to manage correctly. In theory proper use of an MDM can make services provisioning simpler with configuration profiles to reach authorized services."

   - id: 18510
     title: "Ensure iCloud Drive Document and Desktop Sync Is Disabled."
     description: "With macOS 10.12, Apple introduced the capability to have a user's Desktop and Documents folders automatically synchronize to the user's iCloud Drive, provided they have enough room purchased through Apple on their iCloud Drive. This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability. The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras, and all iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more, storage may be tight using the free 5GB provided without purchasing much larger storage capacity from Apple. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well. Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations, such as iCloud Drive or DropBox, the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files. The automatic synchronization of all files in a user's Desktop and Documents folders should be disabled. https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/icloud-desktop-and-documents-in-macos-sierra-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/."
     rationale: "Automated Document synchronization should be planned and controlled to approved storage."
     impact: "Users will not be able to use iCloud for the automatic sync of the Desktop and Documents folders."

  # 2.1.1.4 Audit Security Keys Used With AppleIDs. (Manual)
   - id: 18511
     title: "Audit Security Keys Used With AppleIDs."
     description: "Apple has introduced the capability of using security keys to protect AppleIDs using two-factor authentication in macOS Ventura 13.2 and in iOS 16.3 and iPadOS 16.3. This feature along with the purchase of two hardware tokens (a backup device is required) protects against the compromise of AppleIDs. This feature requires all devices using an enrolled Apple ID to meet the minimum OS standard."
     rationale: "Users of Apple devices are supported across their devices by using the same Apple ID to support shard data in both iCloud and across devices. Compromising an AppleID has become a very attractive target for attackers to gain unauthorized access to iCloud storage and user devices. Two-factor authentication reduces the risk."
     impact: "Legacy devices and test machines will be challenging to ensure that they are all running recent Operating Systems that can utilize Security Keys. It is best practice not to use AppleIDs with access to current user data on legacy and test machines. Technical staff that use legacy devices are encouraged to create additional Apple IDs that do not need two-factor protection and can be used for testing on legacy devices when required."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to set Security Keys is set to your organization's requirements: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select Apple ID 3.

     title: "Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled When Not Actively Transferring Files."
     description: "AirDrop is Apple's built-in, on-demand, ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other. In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you. While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific user operational concerns. - - If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither process is desirable. In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service. AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange. For organizations concerned about any use of AirDrop because of Digital Loss Prevention (DLP) monitoring on other protocols, JAMF has an article on reviewing AirDrop logs. Detecting outbound AirDrop transfers and logging them."
     rationale: "AirDrop can allow malicious files to be downloaded from unknown sources. Contacts Only limits may expose personal information to devices in the same area."

     title: "Ensure Time Is Set Within Appropriate Limits."
     description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds. For this audit, a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems, the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time, this check is not strict, so it may be too great for your organization. Your organization can adjust to a smaller offset value as needed. If there are consistent drift issues on the OS, some of the most common drift issues should be investigated: - The chosen time server is not reachable based on network firewall rules on the current network - The computer is offline often and the battery drains, and the network is not immediately available - The chosen time server is a special internal or non-public time server that does not provide a reliable time source Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command."
     rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind."

While sharing the computer’s screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer. While mature administration and management does not use graphical connections for standard maintenance, most help desks have capabilities to assist users in performing their work when they have technical issues and need support. Help desks use graphical remote tools to understand what the user sees and assist them so they can get back to work. For MacOS, some of these remote capabilities can use Apple's OS tools. Control is therefore not meant to prohibit the use of a just-in-time graphical view from authorized personnel with authentication controls. Sharing should not be enabled except in narrow windows when help desk support is required. Screen Sharing on macOS can allow the use of the insecure VNC protocol. VNC is a clear text protocol that should not be used on macOS."

This includes other macOS computers. Apple warns that SMB sharing stored passwords is less secure, and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account.

     rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."
     impact: "The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts. For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered: - Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out. - Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server. - Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark."

     title: "Ensure Content Caching Is Disabled."
     description: "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra), Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints or greater bandwidth exist on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets, the effectiveness of this capability would be determined by how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new, large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity and bandwidth, user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data. Content types supported by Content Caching in macOS."
     rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases, organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."

     title: "Ensure Computer Name Does Not Contain PII or Protected Organizational Information."
     description: "If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily. For organizations or for users that self-administer their own computers, it is important to not use sensitive or personal information in computer names. The name of a computer that uses untrusted networks will be exposed at a minimum to the responsible network team of that network. For instance, having your name as your hostname can provide useful knowledge to an attacker monitoring the network you may be connected to. Examples of possibly inappropriate content in computer names include: - User directory account names - Computer directory account names where machine accounts exist - Contact phone numbers - Physical locations of offices or residences - Personal information that can be augmented with Facebook data to assist social engineering attacks Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users. With mobile devices, using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks; hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the \"Computer Name\" DNS and Directory environments, it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory."
     rationale: "Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices for which an organization is responsible. Without a complete inventory, it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices. Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default, the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change, there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many \"Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro\" should there be, and are any missing? Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes, the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks. A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security."

One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not, it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique, complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use. While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult, backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes."

  # 2.5.2 Ensure Listen for "Hey Siri" Is Disabled. (Manual)
   - id: 18537
     title: "Ensure Listen for "Hey Siri" Is Disabled."
     description: "macOS includes the Siri digital assistant and if enabled it is always listening in case it is needed. In Sonoma a user may choose either \"Hey Siri\" or either \"Siri\" and \"Hey Siri\", in either case Siri is using the microphone at all times to listen for instructions and then can record questions once activated. In an organizational environment where people are talking and listening on video/voice calls there are too many opportunities for unauthorized information disclosure to have a live microphone at all times. If Siri will be used it may be on, with \"Listen for\" Off and a keyboard shortcut selected."
     rationale: "In most environments there is too much unbounded risk of data spillage with a microphone always on listening for instruction and if attention is obtained listening for questions, relying on cloud compute to answer them. There are many examples of data leakage for technology in this space, future vulnerabilities and bugs are certainly possible."
     impact: "Siri will not be available for hands free usage, or not available at all if turned off completely."
     remediation: "Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.Siri 2. The key to include is set to 3. The key must be set to <false/> Note: After testing, this profile will disable Hey Siribut only for the first input but not additional inputs. It cannot be assumed that there will only be one input, so setting this recommendation is advised but cannot fully be assessed. For the time being this recommendation is currently not automated, but will be in future releases if we can properly configure this recommendation."

They do not need to specify their location for weather or travel times, and they will receive alerts on travel times to meetings and appointments where location information is supplied. Location Services simplify some processes with mobile computers, such as asset management and time or log management.

Most of that activity is not from an advanced attacker and can be considered background noise to a patched, hardened device. Advanced attackers are of more concern and a risk review to understand organizational targets and use Lockdown Mode where appropriate is necessary."
     impact: "Lockdown Mode must be tested appropriately for real-world impact on users prior to use. As a new feature there is not sufficient technical reporting on user impacts."

In macOS, the screen saver starts after a value is selected in the drop-down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script, but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts."

  # 2.11.2 Audit Touch ID. (Manual)

     description: "Apple has integrated Touch ID with macOS and allows fingerprint use for many common operations. All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the use of that password after every reboot, or when more than 48 hours has elapsed since the device was last unlocked. Touch ID is not a password replacement. The use of Touch ID can, however, make the use of passwords more secure for authorized users with physical access to a Mac. Normal day-to-day work operations can eliminate the use of console password entry unless a reboot is required other than on Monday morning. The infrequency of password screen unlock can enable a more complicated pass phrase that is seldom used. When Touch ID is used it remediates the risk of shoulder surfing (including video surveillance) to capture console credentials. There have been many reported shoulder surfing password captures on iOS devices. Reports have not been widespread on Macs, but shoulder surfing password capture is simpler than the other methods of breaking in to an encrypted Mac. When a SmartCard or YubiKey is provisioned by an organization and is available for Console authentication, that is a much more secure option than the use of Touch ID and is preferred."

Game Center is a feature from Apple that allows users to engage in game-related activities with friends when playing multiplayer games online on the Game Center social network. User profile data such as nickname, contact discovery, and also nearby players may be shared through iCloud. Apple collects information here, such as the games users play and when they play them, all scores and achievements, and the challenges users send and receive. This information is used to track users' high scores, achievements, and challenges and to improve Game Center. The automatic sign in to Game Center with AppleID should be disabled if not aligned with organizational rules Personal profile visibility, Finding by Friends, requests from Contacts, Nearby Player detection and Connecting with Friends are all visibility options that should be risk accepted through an organizational policy before use. Users should not sign in to Game Center on organizational managed devices if not covered under acceptable use. For personal devices Game Center should not be signed in if the user is not using Apple's gaming service."
     rationale: "Ensure Game Center service is used consistently with organizational requirements."
     impact: "Game Center is designed as a social network to use Apple's gaming service and includes capabilities to discover players in the service as through local network discovery. If the Apple feature is not needed it should not be on, and should not be signed in."
     remediation: "Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.applicationaccess 2. The key to include is allowGameCenter 3. The key should be set <true/>, to allow Game Center, or <false/>, to disable it, based on your organization's requirements."

     title: "Audit Notification & Focus Settings."
     description: "Notification capabilities are designed to allow users to receive updates from applications that are not currently in use. These can be background applications or even notices from processes running on a computer that is not currently being actively used. Where the screen of a computer is visible to others other than the logged-in user due to shared working spaces or public spaces, consideration should be given to the exposure of sensitive data in notifications. Applications that use the system-wide application service may be individually managed, and applications that might expose confidential information to unauthorized users should not expose notifications except to the current user, especially on the locked screen when the computer may be unattended."
     rationale: "Some work environments will handle sensitive or confidential information with applications that can provide notifications to anyone who can see the computer screen. Organizations must review the likelihood that information may be exposed inappropriately and suppress notifications where risk is not organizationally accepted."
     impact: "Computer users are often juggling too much information through too many applications that want their attention and are often designed to get attention and never let it go. Notifications are a mechanism that can be used to cut through the deluge and allow important issues to be resolved in a timely way. Global controls on limiting user notifications, even for certain applications, could impact productivity and the timely remediation of issues."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to set Notifications to your organization's requirements: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select Notifications 3. Select any applications that are not in compliance with your organization's requirements 4. Turn off or mute notifications that may expose information to unauthorized people that might be able to view screens of organizational computers."

Apple Pay allows an Apple account holder to enroll their credit cards in Apple Pay and pay enrolled vendors without using the physical card or number. Apple's service eliminates the requirement to send the credit card number itself to the vendor. Apple Pay on a Mac allows the use of credit cards the user has already enrolled and reduces user risk for credit card purchases."
     rationale: "Some environments may have rules around purchases from organizationally managed computers and may want to discourage shopping from them.

Setting up an Internet Account allows the user to configure access to pre-existing accounts that are Internet Accessible. The Internet Accounts section is not managing network access to firewall rules, it only provides a location to manage credentials and audit external accounts for applications that make use of the \"Internet Accounts\". Some applications, like Thunderbird and Firefox, do not natively use Internet Accounts and store credentials with the application settings. Disabling the Internet Accounts section does not block access if network reachable, it just makes auditing and use more difficult. Depending on the maturity of network controls auditing the providers listed in Internet Accounts is part of managing acceptable use."

     title: "Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size."
     description: "macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization. The default value has an \"all_max\" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention, and a less precise rotation argument. The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year, and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year. While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag, the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired. Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information. man asl.conf - The maximum file size limitation string should be removed \"all_max=\" - An organization appropriate retention should be added \"ttl=\" - The rotation should be set with timestamps \"rotate=utc\" or \"rotate=local\"."
     rationale: "Archiving and retaining install.log for at least a year is beneficial in the event of an incident as it will allow the user to view the various changes to the system along with the date and time they occurred."

  # 3.7 Audit Software Inventory. (Manual)
   - id: 18577
     title: "Audit Software Inventory."
     description: "With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple added a new application, App Store, which resides in the Applications directory. This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple ID to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no-cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage, or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness. A single user desktop where the user, administrator, and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware, however. Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next. Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable."
     rationale: "Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user, and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources, if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications. Neither Apple capabilities nor third-party patch management solutions will cover all mission-necessary software for most organizations. Full visibility into software present on the system enables vulnerability and risk management. P.S. Don't forget about browser plugins/extensions for all installed software."
     remediation: "Delete any unnecessary applications from the system."

     description: "Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled."
     rationale: "Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of \"I'm here!\" messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed."
     impact: "Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off."

Another user on the same system can see you have a \"Documents\" folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system. The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures. Similarly with macOS, users can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions. Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls. Some environments may encounter problems if execute rights are removed as well as read and write. Either no access or execute only for group or others is acceptable."

Add the line Defaults timestamp_type=tty to the configuration file. Note: The Defaults timestamp_type=tty line can be added to an existing configuration file or a new one.

     title: "Ensure Advertising Privacy Protection in Safari Is Enabled."
     description: "Apple provides a framework that allows advertisers to target Apple users and end-users with advertisements. While many people prefer that when they see advertising it is relevant to them and their interests, the detailed information that is data mining collected, correlated, and available to advertisers in repositories is often disconcerting. This information is valuable to both advertisers and attackers and has been used with other metadata to reveal users' identities. Organizations should manage advertising settings on computers rather than allow users to configure the settings. Apple Information Ad tracking should be limited on 10.15 and prior."
     rationale: "Organizations should manage user privacy settings on managed devices to align with organizational policies and user data protection requirements."
     impact: "Uses will see generic advertising rather than targeted advertising. Apple warns that this will reduce the number of relevant ads."

  # 6.3.8 Audit Autofill. (Manual)
   - id: 18614
     title: "Audit Autofill."
     description: "Autofill capabilities in a Web Browser are a feature to allow a user to avoid re-typing the same user information in every form that a user encounters. Part of the modern internet consists of vendors establishing a seemingly close relationship with as many users as possible to market to them, data-mine form them and sell their data to third parry data aggregators. Autofill can be a method for a user to share too much information with untrusted website owners. Many security professionals advise disabling autofill to reduce the risk of over-sharing. These security professionals appear to believe that manual data entry is better, since completing the required forms are often the only method to connect to needed data. The best method for security is to ensure that the data ready to be auto-filled is an acceptable risk to sites a user interacts with. Users must review what data they accept the risk to share."
     rationale: "Auditing and accepting information a user is willing to share prior to loading the blank form is the best way to manage risk."
