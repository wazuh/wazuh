    description: "Software vendors release security patches and software updates for their products when security vulnerabilities are discovered. There is no simple way to complete this action without a network connection to an Apple software repository. Please ensure appropriate access for this control. This check is only for what Apple provides through software update. Software updates should be run at minimum every 30 days. Run the following command to verify when software update was previously run: $ /usr/bin/sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate | grep -e LastFullSuccessfulDate. The response should be in the last 30 days (Example): LastFullSuccessfulDate = '2020-07-30 12:45:25 +0000';."
    rationale: "It is important that these updates be applied in a timely manner to prevent unauthorized persons from exploiting the identified vulnerabilities."

    title: "Ensure Software Update Deferment Is Less Than or Equal to 30 Days."
    description: "Apple provides the capability to manage software updates on Apple devices through mobile device management. Part of those capabilities permit organizations to defer software updates and allow for testing. Many organizations have specialized software and configurations that may be negatively impacted by Apple updates. If software updates are deferred, they should not be deferred for more than 30 days. This control only verifies that deferred software updates are not deferred for more than 30 days."
    rationale: "Apple software updates almost always include security updates. Attackers evaluate updates to create exploit code in order to attack unpatched systems. The longer a system remains unpatched, the greater an exploit possibility exists in which there are publicly reported vulnerabilities."

  # 2.2.2 Ensure Firewall Stealth Mode Is Enabled (Automated)
  - id: 30008
    title: "Ensure Firewall Stealth Mode Is Enabled."
    description: "While in Stealth mode, the computer will not respond to unsolicited probes, dropping that traffic."
    rationale: "Stealth mode on the firewall minimizes the threat of system discovery tools while connected to a network or the Internet."
    impact: "Traditional network discovery tools like ping will not succeed. Other network tools that measure activity and approved applications will work as expected. This control aligns with the primary macOS use case of a laptop that is often connected to untrusted networks where host segregation may be non-existent. In that use case, hiding from the other inmates is likely more than desirable. In use cases where use is only on trusted LANs with static IP addresses, stealth mode may not be desirable."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to enable firewall stealth mode: Open System Settings. Select Network. Select Firewall. Set Enabled stealth mode to enabled. Terminal Method: Run the following command to enable stealth mode: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setstealthmode on. Stealth mode enabled Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: The PayloadType string is com.apple.security.firewall. The key to include is EnableStealthMode. The key must be set to <true/>. Note: This key must be set in the same configuration profile with EnableFirewall set to <true/>. If it is set in its own configuration profile, it will fail."

    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates, and log entries. Note: If your organization has internal time servers, enter them here. Enterprise mobile devices may need to use a mix of internal and external time servers. If multiple servers are required, use the Date & Time System Preference with each server separated by a space. Additional Note: The default Apple time server is time.apple.com. Variations include time.euro.apple.com. While it is certainly more efficient to use internal time servers, there is no reason to block access to global Apple time servers or to add a time.apple.com alias to internal DNS records. There are no reports that Apple gathers any information from NTP synchronization, as the computers already phone home to Apple for Apple services including iCloud use and software updates. Best practice is to allow DNS resolution to an authoritative time service for time.apple.com, preferably to connect to Apple servers, but local servers are acceptable as well."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features."

    title: "Ensure Time Is Set Within Appropriate Limits."
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds. For this audit, a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems, the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time, this check is not strict, so it may be too great for your organization. Your organization can adjust to a smaller offset value as needed. If there are consistent drift issues on the OS, some of the most common drift issues should be investigated: - The chosen time server is not reachable based on network firewall rules on the current network. - The computer is offline often and the battery drains, and the network is not immediately available. - The chosen time server is a special internal or non-public time server that does not provide a reliable time source. Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind."

    title: "Ensure DVD or CD Sharing Is Disabled."
    description: "DVD or CD Sharing allows users to remotely access the system's optical drive. While Apple does not ship Macs with built-in optical drives any longer, external optical drives are still recognized when they are connected. In testing, the sharing of an external optical drive persists when a drive is reconnected."
    rationale: "Disabling DVD or CD Sharing minimizes the risk of an attacker using the optical drive as a vector for attack and exposure of sensitive data."
    impact: "Many Apple devices are now sold without optical drives, however drive sharing may be needed for legacy optical media. The media should be explicitly re-shared as needed rather than using a persistent share. Optical drives should not be used for long-term storage. To store necessary data from an optical drive it should be copied to another form of external storage. Optionally, an image can be made of the optical drive so that it is stored in its original form on another form of external storage."

    title: "Ensure Screen Sharing Is Disabled."
    description: "Screen Sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer's screen. While sharing the computer's screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer. While mature administration and management does not use graphical connections for standard maintenance, most help desks have capabilities to assist users in performing their work when they have technical issues and need support. Help desks use graphical remote tools to understand what the user sees and assist them so they can get back to work. For MacOS, some of these remote capabilities can use Apple's OS tools. Control is therefore not meant to prohibit the use of a just-in-time graphical view from authorized personnel with authentication controls. Sharing should not be enabled except in narrow windows when help desk support is required."
    rationale: "Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer."

  # 2.3.3.3 Ensure File Sharing Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30013
    title: "Ensure File Sharing Is Disabled."
    description: "File sharing from a user workstation creates additional risks, such as: - Open ports are created that can be probed and attacked. - Passwords are attached to user accounts for access that may be exposed and endanger other parts of the organizational environment, including directory accounts. - Increased complexity makes security more difficult and may expose additional attack vectors. Apple's File Sharing uses the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol to share to other computers that can mount SMB shares. This includes other macOS computers. Apple warns that SMB sharing stored passwords is less secure, and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user accessing the Mac must have SMB enabled. Storing passwords, especially copies of valid directory passwords, decrease security for the directory account and should not be used."
    rationale: "By disabling File Sharing, the remote attack surface and risk of unauthorized access to files stored on the system is reduced."
    impact: "File Sharing can be used to share documents with other users, but hardened servers should be used rather than user endpoints. Turning on File Sharing increases the visibility and attack surface of a system unnecessarily."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to disable File Sharing: 1 Open System Settings. 2 Select General. 3 Select Sharing. 4 Set File Sharing to disabled. Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable File Sharing: $ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/launchctl disable system/com.apple.smbd"

  # 2.3.3.5 Ensure Remote Login Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30015
    title: "Ensure Remote Login Is Disabled."
    description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
    rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."
    impact: "The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts. For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered: - Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out. - Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server. - Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark."

    title: "Ensure Content Caching Is Disabled."
    description: "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra), Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints or greater bandwidth exist on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets, the effectiveness of this capability would be determined by how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new, large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity and bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204675."
    rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk, they add to the management complexity. Since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."
    impact: "This setting will adversely affect bandwidth usage between local subnets and the Internet."

    title: "Ensure Time Machine Volumes Are Encrypted If Time Machine Is Enabled."
    description: "One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use. While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes."
    rationale: "Backup volumes need to be encrypted."
    remediation: "Perform the following steps to enable encryption on the Time Machine drive: Open System Settings. Select General. Select Time Machine. Select the unencrypted drive. Select - to forget that drive as a destination. Select + to add a different drive as the destination. Select Set Up Disk... Set Encrypt Backup to enabled. Enter a password in the New Password and the same password in the Re-enter Password fields. A password hint is required, but it is recommended that you do not use any identifying information for the password. Note: In macOS 12.0 Monterey and previous, the existing Time Machine drive could have encryption added without formatting it. This is no longer possible in macOS 13.0 Ventura. If you with to keep previous backups from the unencrypted volume, you will need to manually move those files over to the new encrypted drive."

    title: "Ensure Power Nap Is Disabled for Intel Macs."
    description: "Power Nap allows the system to stay in low power mode, especially while on battery power, and periodically connect to previously known networks with stored credentials for user applications to phone home and get updates. This capability requires FileVault to remain unlocked and the use of previously joined networks to be risk accepted based on the SSID without user input. This control has been updated to check the status on both battery and AC Power. The presence of an electrical outlet does not completely correlate with logical and physical security of the device or available networks."
    rationale: "Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access. The use of Power Nap adds to the risk of compromised physical and logical security. The user should be able to decrypt FileVault and have the applications download what is required when the computer is actively used. The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs."
    impact: "Power Nap exists for unattended user application updates like email and social media clients. With Power Nap disabled, the computer will not wake and reconnect to known wireless SSIDs intermittently when slept."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to disable Power Nap: Desktop Instructions: Open System Settings. Select Energy Saver. Set Power Nap to disabled. Select UPS (if applicable). Set Power Nap to disabled. Laptop Instructions: Open System Settings. Select Battery. Select Power Adapter (for laptops only). Set Power Nap to disabled. Select Battery. Set Power Nap to disabled. Select UPS (if applicable). Set Power Nap to disabled. Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable Power Nap: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a powernap 0."

  # 2.9.2 Ensure Wake for Network Access Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30033
    title: "Ensure Wake for Network Access Is Disabled."
    description: "This feature allows the computer to take action when the user is not present and the computer is in energy saving mode. These tools require FileVault to remain unlocked and fully rejoin known networks. This macOS feature is meant to allow the computer to resume activity as needed regardless of physical security controls. This feature allows other users to be able to access your computer's shared resources, such as shared printers or Apple Music playlists, even when your computer is in sleep mode. In a closed network when only authorized devices could wake a computer, it could be valuable to wake computers in order to do management push activity. Where mobile workstations and agents exist, the device will more likely check in to receive updates when already awake. Mobile devices should not be listening for signals on any unmanaged network or where untrusted devices exist that could send wake signals."
    rationale: "Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access."
    impact: "Management programs like Apple Remote Desktop Administrator use wake-on-LAN to connect with computers. If turned off, such management programs will not be able to wake a computer over the LAN. If the wake-on-LAN feature is needed, do not turn off this feature. The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark. Forcing the computer to stay on and use energy in case a management push is needed is contrary to most current management processes. Only keep computers unslept if after hours pushes are required on closed LANs."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to disable Wake for network access: Desktop Instructions: Open System Settings. Select Energy Saver. Set Wake for network access to disabled. Laptop Instructions: Open System Settings. Select Battery. Select Options... Set Wake for network access to Never. Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable Wake for network access: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a womp 0 Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: The PayloadType string is com.apple.MCX. The key to include is com.apple.EnergySaver.desktop.ACPower. The key must be set to: <dict> <key>Wake On LAN</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>Wake On Modem Ring</key> <integer>0</integer> </dict>. The key to also include is com.apple.EnergySaver.portable.ACPower. The key must be set to: <dict> <key>Wake On LAN</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>Wake On Modem Ring</key> <integer>0</integer> </dict>.

The key must be set to: <dict> <key>Wake On LAN</key> <integer>0</integer> <key>Wake On Modem Ring</key> <integer>0</integer> </dict>. Note: Both Wake on LAN and Wake on Modem Ring need to be set. Only setting Wake On LAN will allow the profile to install but not set any settings. This profile will only apply the setting at installation and is not sticky."

  - id: 30034
    title: "Ensure an Inactivity Interval of 20 Minutes Or Less for the Screen Saver Is Enabled."
    description: "A locking screen saver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screen saver starts after a value is selected in the dropdown menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script, but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts."
    rationale: "Setting an inactivity interval for the screen saver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time."
    impact: "If the screen saver is not set, users may leave the computer available for an unauthorized person to access information."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following to set the screen saver to activate in 20 minutes or less: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select Lock Screen 3. Set Start Screen Saver when inactive to a selection that is 20 minutes or less (≤1200) Terminal Method: Run the following command to set individual users to an idle time of the screen saver is set to 20 minutes or less (≤1200): $ /usr/bin/sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int <value ≤1200> Note: Issues arise if the command line is used to make the setting something other than what is available in the GUI Menu. Choose either 1 (60), 2 (120), 5 (300), 10 (600), or 20 (1200) minutes to avoid any issues. Profile Method: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.screensaver 2. The key to include is idleTime 3. The key must be set to <integer><≤1200></integer> Note: Since the profile method sets a system-wide setting and not a user-level one, the profile method is the preferred method.

  - id: 30042
    title: "Ensure Security Auditing Flags For User-Attributable Events Are Configured Per Local Organizational Requirements."
    description: "Auditing is the capture and maintenance of information about security-related events. Auditable events often depend on differing organizational requirements."
    rationale: "Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements. The flags selected below may not adequately meet organizational requirements for users of this benchmark. The auditing checks for the flags proposed here will not impact additional flags that are selected."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to set the required Security Auditing Flags: Edit the /etc/security/audit_control file and add -fm, ad, -ex, aa, -fr, lo, and -fw to flags. You can also substitute -all for -fm, -ex, -fr, and -fw."

  # 3.3 Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size (Automated)
  - id: 30043
    title: "Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size."
    description: "macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization. The default value has an 'all_max' file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention, and a less precise rotation argument. The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year, and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year. While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag, the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired. Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information. 'man asl.conf' • The maximum file size limitation string should be removed 'all_max=' • An organization appropriate retention should be added 'ttl=' • The rotation should be set with timestamps 'rotate=utc' or 'rotate=local'."
    rationale: "Archiving and retaining install.log for at least a year is beneficial in the event of an incident as it will allow the user to view the various changes to the system along with the date and time they occurred."
    impact: "Without log files system maintenance and security forensics cannot be properly performed."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to ensure that install logs are retained for at least 365 days: Edit the /etc/asl/com.apple.install file and add or modify the ttl value to 365 or greater on the file line. Also, remove the all_max= setting and value from the file line."

This resource is only completely useful if it is retained long enough to allow technical staff to find the root cause of anomalies in the records. Retention can be set to respect both size and longevity. To retain as much as possible under a certain size, the recommendation is to use the following: expire-after:60d OR 5G This recomendation is based on minimum storage for review and investigation. When a third party tool is in use to allow remote logging or the store and forwarding of logs, this local storage requirement is not required."
    rationale: "The audit records need to be retained long enough to be reviewed as necessary."

    title: "Ensure Access to Audit Records Is Controlled."
    description: "The audit system on macOS writes important operational and security information that can be both useful for an attacker and a place for an attacker to attempt to obfuscate unwanted changes that were recorded. As part of defense-in-depth the /etc/security/audit_control configuration and the files in /var/audit should be owned only by root with group wheel with read-only rights and no other access allowed. macOS ACLs should not be used for these files."
    rationale: "Audit records should never be changed except by the system daemon posting events. Records may be viewed or extracts manipulated, but the authoritative files should be protected from unauthorized changes."
    impact: "This control is only checking the default configuration to ensure that unwanted access to audit records is not available."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following to commands to set the audit records to the root user and wheel group: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown -R root:wheel /etc/security/audit_control $ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R o-rw /etc/security/audit_control $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown -R root:wheel /var/audit/ $ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/chmod -R o-rw /var/audit/ Note: It is recommended to do a thorough verification process on why the audit logs have been changed before following the remediation steps. If the system has different access controls on the audit logs, and the changes cannot be traced, a new install may be prudent. Check for signs of file tampering as well as unapproved OS changes."

  # 3.6 Ensure Firewall Logging Is Enabled and Configured (Automated)
  - id: 30046
    title: "Ensure Firewall Logging Is Enabled and Configured."
    description: "The socketfilter Firewall is what is used when the Firewall is turned on in the Security & Privacy Preference Pane. In order to appropriately monitor what access is allowed and denied, logging must be enabled. The logging level must be set to 'detailed' to be useful in monitoring connection attempts that the firewall detects. Throttled login is not sufficient for examine Firewall connection attempts. In depth log monitoring on macOS may require changes to the 'Enable-Private-Data' key in SystemLogging.System to ensure more complete logging."
    rationale: "In order to troubleshoot the successes and failures of a Firewall, detailed logging should be enabled."
    impact: "Detailed logging may result in excessive storage."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to enable logging of the firewall: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setloggingmode on Turning on log mode $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setloggingopt detail Setting detail log option Note: If the Firewall settings are set through a configuration profile, then modifications cannot be done through the command line. If attempted, you will receive the message: Firewall settings cannot be modified from command line on managed Mac computers. Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.security.firewall 2. The key to include is EnableFirewall 3. The key must be set to <true/> 4. The key to also include is EnableLogging 5. The key must be set to <true/> 6. The key to also include is LoggingOption 7. The key must be set to <string>detail</string> Note: Firewall Logging must be enabled with this profile. It can either be set with the Firewall and Stealth Mode (2.5.2.2 and 2.5.2.3) or as a separate profile. Setting logging with its own profile will not cause a conflict."

  # 4.1 Ensure Bonjour Advertising Services Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30047
    title: "Ensure Bonjour Advertising Services Is Disabled."
    description: "Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled."
    rationale: "Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorlyconfigured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed."
    impact: "Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable Bonjour Advertising services: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool true. Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.mDNSResponder 2. The key to include is NoMulticastAdvertisements."

    description: "System Integrity Protection is a security feature introduced in OS X 10.11 El Capitan. System Integrity Protection restricts access to System domain locations and restricts runtime attachment to system processes. Any attempt to inspect or attach to a system process will fail. Kernel Extensions are now restricted to /Library/Extensions and are required to be signed with a Developer ID."
    rationale: "Running without System Integrity Protection on a production system runs the risk of the modification of system binaries or code injection of system processes that would otherwise be protected by SIP."
    impact: "System binaries and processes could become compromised."
    remediation: "Perform the following steps to enable System Integrity Protection: 1. Reboot into the Recovery Partition (reboot and hold down Command (⌘) + R) 2. Select Utilities 3. Select Terminal 4. Run the following command: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/csrutil enable 5. Reboot the computer. Note: You should research why the system had SIP disabled. It might be a better option to erase the Mac and reinstall the operating system. That is at your discretion. Note: You cannot enable System Integrity Protection from the booted operating system. If the remediation is attempted in the booted OS and not the Recovery Partition the output will give the error csrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration.

  # 5.1.4 Ensure Sealed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled (Automated)
  - id: 30052
    title: "Ensure Sealed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled."
    description: "Sealed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur. During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume. The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system. During read operations for files located in the Sealed System Volume, a hash is calculated and compared to the value stored in the Merkle tree."
    rationale: "Running without Sealed System Volume on a production system could run the risk of Apple software that integrates directly with macOS being modified."
    impact: "Apple Software that integrates with the operating system could become compromised."
    remediation: "If SSV has been disabled, assume that the operating system has been compromised. Back up any files, and do a clean install to a known good Operating System."

This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15. The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak."
    rationale: "Old passwords should not be reused."
    impact: "Required password changes will lead to some locked computers requiring admin assistance."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to require that the password must to be different from at least the last 15 passwords: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'usingHistory=<value≥15>' example: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'usingHistory=15' Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy 2. The key to include is pinHistory 3. The key must be set to <integer><value≥15></integer> Note: The profile method is the preferred method for setting password policy since - setglobalpolicy in pwpolicy is deprecated and will likely be removed in a future macOS release."

    description: "The sudo command allows the user to run programs as the root user. Working as the root user allows the user an extremely high level of configurability within the system. This control, along with the control to use a separate timestamp for each tty, limits the window where an unauthorized user, process, or attacker could utilize legitimate credentials that are valid for longer than required."
    rationale: "The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable. This is especially true if an exploit were to gain access to the system, since they would be able to make changes as a root user."
    impact: "This control has a serious impact where users often have to use sudo. It is even more of an impact where users have to use sudo multiple times in quick succession as part of normal work processes. Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period. In some ways the use of sudo -s, which is undesirable, is better than a long grace period since that use does change the hash to show that it is a root shell rather than a normal shell where sudo commands will be implemented without a password."
    remediation: "Run the following command to edit the sudo settings: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/<configuration file name>. Note: Unlike other Unix and/or Linux distros, macOS will ignore configuration files in the sudoers.d folder that contain a . so do not add a file extension to the configuration file. Add the line Defaults timestamp_timeout=0 to the configuration file.

    description: "Using tty tickets ensures that a user must enter the sudo password in each Terminal session. With sudo versions 1.8 and higher, introduced in 10.12, the default value is to have tty tickets for each interface so that root access is limited to a specific terminal. The default configuration can be overwritten or not configured correctly on earlier versions of macOS."
    rationale: "In combination with removing the sudo timeout grace period, a further mitigation should be in place to reduce the possibility of a background process using elevated rights when a user elevates to root in an explicit context or tty. Additional mitigation should be in place to reduce the risk of privilege escalation of background processes."
    impact: "This control should have no user impact. Developers or installers may have issues if background processes are spawned with different interfaces than where sudo was executed."

    rationale: "Enabling and using the root account puts the system at risk since any successful exploit or mistake while the root account is in use could have unlimited access privileges within the system.

    title: "Ensure Automatic Opening of Safe Files in Safari Is Disabled."
    description: "Safari will automatically run or execute what it considers safe files. This can include installers and other files that execute on the operating system. Safari evaluates file safety by using a list of filetypes maintained by Apple. The list of files include text, image, video and archive formats that would be run in the context of the OS rather than the browser."
    rationale: "Hackers have taken advantage of this setting via drive-by attacks. These attacks occur when a user visits a legitimate website that has been corrupted. The user unknowingly downloads a malicious file either by closing an infected pop-up or hovering over a malicious banner. An attacker can create a malicious file that will fall within Safari's safe file list that will download and execute without user input."
    impact: "Apple considers many files that the operating system itself auto-executes as 'safe files.' Many of these files could be malicious and could execute locally without the user even knowing that a file of a specific type had been downloaded."
    remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to set safe files to not open after downloading in Safari: 1. Open Safari 2. Select Safari from the menu bar 3. Select Settings 4. Select General 5. Set Open 'safe' files after downloading to disabled.

    description: "Apple provides a framework that allows advertisers to target Apple users and end-users with advertisements. While many people prefer that when they see advertising it is relevant to them and their interests, the detailed information that is data mining collected, correlated, and available to advertisers in repositories is often disconcerting. This information is valuable to both advertisers and attackers and has been used with other metadata to reveal users' identities. Organizations should manage advertising settings on computers rather than allow users to configure the settings. https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/apple-advertising/ Ad tracking should be limited on 10.15 and prior."
