  # 4.1 Ensure Bonjour Advertising Services Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30038
    title: "Ensure Bonjour Advertising Services Is Disabled."
    description: "Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on macOS is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled."
    rationale: "Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of 'I'm here!' messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed."
    impact: "Some applications, like Final Cut Studio and AirPort Base Station management, may not operate properly if the mDNSResponder is turned off."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to disable Bonjour Advertising services: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements -bool true. Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.mDNSResponder 2. The key to include is NoMulticastAdvertisements."

  # 4.2 Ensure HTTP Server Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30039
    title: "Ensure HTTP Server Is Disabled."
    description: "macOS used to have a graphical front-end to the embedded Apache web server in the Operating System. Personal web sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to download files or information from the user's computer. Personal web sharing from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable, and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. Apache, however, is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to share files and provide remote connectivity to an end-user computer. Web sharing should only be done through hardened web servers and appropriate cloud services."
    rationale: "Web serving should not be done from a user desktop. Dedicated webservers or appropriate cloud storage should be used. Open ports make it easier to exploit the computer."

  # 4.3 Ensure NFS Server Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 30040
    title: "Ensure NFS Server Is Disabled."
    description: "macOS can act as an NFS fileserver. NFS sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to mount shares and gain access to information from the user's computer. File sharing from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable, and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. NFSD is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to export shares and provide remote connectivity to an end-user computer. The etc/exports file contains the list of NFS shared directories. If the file exists, it is likely that NFS sharing has been enabled in the past or may be available periodically.

    title: "Ensure System Integrity Protection Status (SIP) Is Enabled."
    description: "System Integrity Protection is a security feature introduced in OS X 10.11 El Capitan. System Integrity Protection restricts access to System domain locations and restricts runtime attachment to system processes. Any attempt to inspect or attach to a system process will fail. Kernel Extensions are now restricted to /Library/Extensions and are required to be signed with a Developer ID."
    rationale: "Running without System Integrity Protection on a production system runs the risk of the modification of system binaries or code injection of system processes that would otherwise be protected by SIP."
    impact: "System binaries and processes could become compromised."
    remediation: "Perform the following steps to enable System Integrity Protection: 1. Reboot into the Recovery Partition (reboot and hold down Command (⌘) + R) 2. Select Utilities 3. Select Terminal 4. Run the following command: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/csrutil enable Successfully enabled System Integrity Protection. Please restart the machine for the changes to take effect. 5. Reboot the computer. Note: You should research why the system had SIP disabled. It might be a better option to erase the Mac and reinstall the operating system. That is at your discretion. Note: You cannot enable System Integrity Protection from the booted operating system. If the remediation is attempted in the booted OS and not the Recovery Partition the output will give the error csrutil: failed to modify system integrity configuration. This tool needs to be executed from the Recovery OS."

    title: "Ensure Sealed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled."
    description: "Sealed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur. During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume. The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system. During read operations for files located in the Sealed System Volume, a hash is calculated and compared to the value stored in the Merkle tree."
    rationale: "Running without Sealed System Volume on a production system could run the risk of Apple software that integrates directly with macOS being modified."
    impact: "Apple Software that integrates with the operating system could become compromised."
    remediation: "If SSV has been disabled, assume that the operating system has been compromised. Back up any files, and do a clean install to a known good Operating System."

    title: "Ensure Password Account Lockout Threshold Is Configured."
    description: "The account lockout threshold specifies the amount of times a user can enter an incorrect password before a lockout will occur. Ensure that a lockout threshold is part of the password policy on the computer."
    rationale: "The account lockout feature mitigates brute-force password attacks on the system."
    impact: "The number of incorrect log on attempts should be reasonably small to minimize the possibility of a successful password attack, while allowing for honest errors made during a normal user log on. The locked account will auto-unlock after a few minutes when bad password attempts stop. The computer will accept the still-valid password if remembered or recovered."
    remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to set the maximum number of failed login attempts to less than or equal to 5: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'maxFailedLoginAttempts=<value≤5>' Note: When the account lockout threshold is set with pwpolicy, it will also set a reset value to policyAttributeMinutesUntilFailedAuthenticationReset that defaults to 1 minute. You can change this value with the command: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'policyAttributeMinutesUntilFailedAuthenticationReset=<value in minutes>' example: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'maxFailedLoginAttempts=5' /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy 'policyAttributeMinutesUntilFailedAuthenticationReset=10' Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1.

To set the reset value use the key autoEnableInSeconds and set the key to <integer><value in seconds></integer>. Note: The profile method is the preferred method for setting password policy since - setglobalpolicy in pwpolicy is deprecated and will likely be removed in a future macOS release."

    description: "Over time, passwords can be captured by third parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or merely brute-force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed), users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 15. The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak."

    description: "The sudo command allows the user to run programs as the root user. Working as the root user allows the user an extremely high level of configurability within the system. This control, along with the control to use a separate timestamp for each tty, limits the window where an unauthorized user, process, or attacker could utilize legitimate credentials that are valid for longer than required."
    rationale: "The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable. This is especially true if an exploit were to gain access to the system, since they would be able to make changes as a root user."
    impact: "This control has a serious impact where users often have to use sudo. It is even more of an impact where users have to use sudo multiple times in quick succession as part of normal work processes. Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period. In some ways the use of sudo -s, which is undesirable, is better than a long grace period since that use does change the hash to show that it is a root shell rather than a normal shell where sudo commands will be implemented without a password."

    description: "Using tty tickets ensures that a user must enter the sudo password in each Terminal session. With sudo versions 1.8 and higher, introduced in 10.12, the default value is to have tty tickets for each interface so that root access is limited to a specific terminal. The default configuration can be overwritten or not configured correctly on earlier versions of macOS."
    rationale: "In combination with removing the sudo timeout grace period, a further mitigation should be in place to reduce the possibility of a background process using elevated rights when a user elevates to root in an explicit context or tty. Additional mitigation should be in place to reduce the risk of privilege escalation of background processes."

  # 5.8 Ensure a Login Window Banner Exists (Automated)
  - id: 30052
    title: "Ensure a Login Window Banner Exists."
    description: "A Login window banner warning informs the user that the system is reserved for authorized use only. It enforces an acknowledgment by the user that they have been informed of the use policy in the banner if required. The system recognizes either the .txt and the .rtf formats."
    rationale: "An access warning may reduce a casual attacker's tendency to target the system. Access warnings may also aid in the prosecution of an attacker by evincing the attacker's knowledge of the system's private status, acceptable use policy, and authorization requirements."
    impact: "Users will have to click on the window with the Login text before logging into the computer."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to create or edit the login window text and set the proper permissions: Edit (or create) a PolicyBanner.txt or PolicyBanner.rtf file, in the /Library/Security/ folder, to include the required login window banner text. Perform the following to set permissions on the policy banner file: $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown o+r /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.txt , $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown o+r /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtf Note: If your organization uses an .rtfd file to set the policy banner, run $ /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/chown -R o+rx /Library/Security/PolicyBanner.rtfd to update the permissions."

  # 5.9 Ensure Legacy EFI Is Valid and Updating (Automated) - Not implemented

  # 5.10 Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist (Automated)
  - id: 30053
    title: "Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist."
    description: "In the previous two controls, the guest account login has been disabled and sharing to guests has been disabled, as well. There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed, you have the option to archive it, leave it in place, or delete. In the case of the guest folder, the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed, it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders, as well. Rather than ignoring the folder's continued existence, it is best removed."
    rationale: "The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately."
    impact: "The Guest account should not be necessary after it is disabled, and it will be automatically re-created if the Guest account is re-enabled."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove the Guest user home folder: $ /usr/bin/sudo /bin/rm -R /Users/Guest"
