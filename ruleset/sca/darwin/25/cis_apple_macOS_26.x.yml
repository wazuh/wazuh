     description: "Software vendors release security patches and software updates for their products when security vulnerabilities are discovered. There is no simple way to complete this action without a network connection to an Apple software repository. Please ensure appropriate access for this control. This check is only for what Apple provides through software update."
     rationale: "It is important that these updates be applied in a timely manner to prevent unauthorized persons from exploiting the identified vulnerabilities."
     impact: "Installation of updates can be disruptive to the users especially if a restart is required. Major updates need to be applied after creating an organizational patch policy. It is also advised to run updates and forced restarts during system downtime and not while in active use. Internal Only - General."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following to install all available software updates: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select General 3. Select Software Update 4. Select Update All Terminal Method: Run the following command to verify what packages need to be installed: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -l The output will include the following: Software Update found the following new or updated software: Note: If the software update server cannot be reached, that will need further investigation. This could be due to a network issue and must be resolved within your organization. Run the following command to install all the packages that need to be updated: To install all updates run the command: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i -a Or run the following command to install individual packages: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/sbin/softwareupdate -i '<package name>' Note: If one of the software updates listed includes Action: restart, then you must attach the -R flag to force a system restart. If the system update is complete but no restart occurs, then the system is in an unknown state that requires a future restart. It is advised to run updates and forced restarts during system downtime and not while in active use.

This capability mirrors what Microsoft is doing with the use of OneDrive and Office 365. There are concerns with using this capability. The storage space that Apple provides for free is used by users with iCloud mail, all of a user's Photo Library created with the ever larger Multi-Pixel iPhone cameras, and all iOS Backups. Adding a synchronization capability for users who have files going back a decade or more, storage may be tight using the free 5GB provided without purchasing much larger storage capacity from Apple. Users with multiple computers running 10.12 and above with unique content on each will have issues as well. Enterprise users may not be allowed to store Enterprise information in a third-party public cloud. In previous implementations, such as iCloud Drive or DropBox, the user selected what files were synchronized even if there were no other controls. The new feature synchronizes all files in a folder widely used to put working files.

This feature along with the purchase of two hardware tokens (a backup device is required) protects against the compromise of Apple Accounts. This feature requires all devices using an enrolled Apple Account to meet the minimum OS standard."
     rationale: "Users of Apple devices are supported across their devices by using the same Apple Account to support shared data in both iCloud and across devices. Compromising an Apple Account has become a very attractive target for attackers to gain unauthorized access to iCloud storage and user devices. Two-factor authentication reduces the risk."

     description: "Find My is Apple's consumer solution for device tracking of your devices. This allows a user to track the location of devices associated with their Apple Account. This is a great solution for consumer or user device management and tracking, but it is not meant to be an enterprise management solution to device tracking and information management on enterprise managed devices. There are multiple enterprise MDM solutions for managing organizational devices."
     rationale: "An enterprise solution should be used for tracking and information management of all devices, including Apple devices. Apple's Find My solution only handles Apple devices. If no enterprise solution is available, Find My provides capabilities for a user to manage and track Apple devices. It is not designed as an enterprise solution, and should not be used as one. It is better to allow the user to track devices that use their Apple Account than to have no tracking at all."
     impact: "There should be no impact on the user while using the device. If someone other than the user has access to tracking information, this can impact the user and needs to be researched. Users should audit to ensure that only authorized people have access to your location. Using multiple solutions for device tracking can unnecessary complexity. One of the advantages of Find My... is that personal tracking is under the context of the user that is signed into their Apple Account on devices and that is secured against unauthorized access. Blocking this solution in favor of enterprise tools could result in personal information loss including the collection, and possible misuse, of personal location information. Organizations should make a risk assessment on device/user tracking for internal use only. Internal Only - General."

     title: "Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled When Not Actively Transferring Files."
     description: "AirDrop is Apple's built-in, on-demand, ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting, it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are near each other. In many ways, this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you. While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards. The recommendation against enabling the sharing is not based on any known lack of security in the protocol, but for specific user operational concerns. - - If AirDrop is enabled, the Mac is advertising that a Mac is addressable on the local network and open to either unwanted AirDrop upload requests or for a negotiation on whether the remote user is in the user's contacts list. Neither process is desirable. In most known use cases, AirDrop use qualifies as ad hoc networking when it involves Apple device users deciding to exchange a file using the service. AirDrop can thus be enabled on the fly for that exchange. For organizations concerned about any use of AirDrop because of Digital Loss Prevention (DLP) monitoring on other protocols, Jamf has an article on reviewing AirDrop logs. Detecting outbound AirDrop transfers and logging them."

     title: "Ensure Screen Sharing Is Disabled."
     description: "Screen Sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer’s screen. While sharing the computer’s screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer. While mature administration and management does not use graphical connections for standard maintenance, most help desks have capabilities to assist users in performing their work when they have technical issues and need support. Help desks use graphical remote tools to understand what the user sees and assist them so they can get back to work. For macOS, some of these remote capabilities can use Apple's OS tools. Control is therefore not meant to prohibit the use of a just-in-time graphical view from authorized personnel with authentication controls. Sharing should not be enabled except in narrow windows when help desk support is required. Screen Sharing on macOS can allow the use of the insecure VNC protocol. VNC is a clear text protocol that should not be used on macOS."
     rationale: "Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer."
     impact: "Help desks may require the periodic use of a graphical connection mechanism to assist users. Any support that relies on native macOS components will not work unless a scripted solution to enable and disable sharing is used, as necessary."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to disable Screen Sharing: 1. Open System Settings 2. Select General 3. Select Sharing 4.

     description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
     rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to POSIX servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP-based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in the Network sub-section. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of OpenSSH by Apple. Since most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP-based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."
     impact: "The SSH server built into macOS should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications, including email, web browser, and productivity tools, should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management toolsets that do utilize SSH. If they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known, trusted IP addresses and appropriate administrator service accounts. For macOS computers that are being used for specialized functions, there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access, including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered: - Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks. This is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system, but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account, they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication, directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out. - Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key, they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server. - Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks, but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark.

This setting only disables the receiving of files and requires both devices to be paired through Bluetooth as well as accepted by the receiver. This setting does not disable the ability to send files from the device to another paired Bluetooth device. Bluetooth pairing only requires an acceptance dialog on either device attempting to pair. It does require the Bluetooth pane in System Settings to be open for any macOS device to be discoverable. While it does give a verification code, it does not require either device to enter the code, but just accept the dialog box (on either device). At that point, the two devices are paired and files can be shared through Bluetooth. To receive files through Bluetooth File Exchange application, the user does have to accept the file(s) through a dialog box. Users should only pair to known trusted Bluetooth devices."

     title: "Ensure Computer Name Does Not Contain PII or Protected Organizational Information."
     description: "If the computer is used in an organization that assigns host names, it is a good idea to change the computer name to the host name. This is more of a best practice than a security measure. If the host name and the computer name are the same, computer support may be able to track problems down more easily. For organizations or for users that self-administer their own computers, it is important to not use sensitive or personal information in computer names. The name of a computer that uses untrusted networks will be exposed at a minimum to the responsible network team of that network. For instance, having your name as your hostname can provide useful knowledge to an attacker monitoring the network you may be connected to. Examples of possibly inappropriate content in computer names include: - User directory account names - Computer directory account names where machine accounts exist - Contact phone numbers - Physical locations of offices or residences - Personal information that can be augmented with Facebook data to assist social engineering attacks Standard naming patterns avoid collisions and mitigate risk for computer users. With mobile devices, using DHCP IP tracking has serious drawbacks. Hostname or computer name tracking makes much more sense for those organizations that can implement it. If the computer is using different names for the \"Computer Name\" DNS and Directory environments, it can be difficult to manage Macs in an Enterprise asset inventory."
     rationale: "Part of IT security is having visibility into all of the devices for which an organization is responsible. Without a complete inventory, it is impossible to ensure all security controls are met on all organizational devices. Default macOS naming deconfliction controls can create issues for appropriate management and tracking as well as privacy exposure. By default, the name of a macOS computer is derived from the first user created. If the user has multiple computers or an image is used without an appropriate name change, there will be multiple computers with names derived from the same user for discovery deconfliction. How many \"Ron Colvin's MacBook Pro\" should there be, and are any missing? Internal Only - General Local network auto renaming to avoid collisions also allows for the enumeration of local computer names. Computers should not be named after their users, especially on untrusted networks. For social engineering purposes, the computer name should not provide a full name of the user or an identifiable name that might be used to assist in targeted user attacks. A documented plan to better enable a complete device inventory without exposing user or organizational information is part of mature security."

     description: "One of the most important security tools for data protection on macOS is FileVault. With encryption in place, it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not, it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting up a Time Machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique, complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use. While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult, backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.

     description: "Apple Intelligence's Notes summarization feature quickly condenses content within the Notes app. This includes summarizing written text you've highlighted or, notably, automatically generating summaries from audio recordings taken directly within Notes, like lectures or meetings, helping you grasp key information at a glance."
     rationale: "Disabling Notes summarization is wise for security if your audio recordings or notes contain very private or sensitive information. While Apple usually keeps your data secure, turning this off ensures none of that sensitive content, especially from transcribed audio, ever leaves your device for any AI processing, giving you maximum control over your confidential data."
     impact: "If you disable Apple Intelligence's Notes summarization feature, the main impact is that the user will not get automatic or on-demand summaries of your written notes or audio recordings."

     title: "Ensure Siri Is Disabled."
     description: "With macOS 10.12 Sierra, Apple has introduced Siri from iOS to macOS. While there are data spillage concerns with the use of data-gathering personal assistant software, the risk here does not seem greater in sending queries to Apple through Siri than in sending search terms in a browser to Google or Microsoft. While it is possible that Siri will be used for local actions rather than Internet searches, Siri could, in theory, tell Apple about confidential Programs and Projects that should not be revealed. This appears to be a usage edge case. In cases where sensitive or protected data is processed and Siri could expose that information through assisting a user in navigating their machine, it should be disabled. Siri does need to phone home to Apple, so it should not be available from air-gapped networks as part of its requirements. Most of the use case data published has shown that Siri is a tremendous time saver on iOS where multiple screens and menus need to be navigated through. Information like sports scores, weather, movie times, and simple to-do items on existing calendars can be easily found with Siri. None of the standard use cases should be more risky than already approved activity. For information on Apple's privacy policy for Siri, click here."
     rationale: "Siri is being disabled because the listen for \"Siri\" or \"Hey Siri\" feature cannot be disabled globally or even through a user specific plist. Due to this, there is no guarantee that Listen for is disabled and therefore the mic is live and capturing everything around it."
     impact: "With Siri is disabled, a user loses the ability to perform hands-free tasks, get quick information, and control their device using voice commands. Internal Only - General."
     remediation: "Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.applicationaccess 2. The key to include is allowAssistant 3. Set the key to <false/>."

  # 2.5.2.2 Ensure Listen for (Siri) Is Disabled. (Manual)
   - id: 18538
     title: "Ensure Listen for (Siri) Is Disabled."
     description: "macOS includes the Siri digital assistant and if enabled it is always listening in case it is needed. In Sonoma a user may choose either \"Hey Siri\" or either \"Siri\" and \"Hey Siri.\" In either case, Siri is using the microphone at all times to listen for instructions and then can record questions once activated. In an organizational environment where people are talking and listening on video/voice calls, there are too many opportunities for unauthorized information disclosure to have a live microphone at all times. If Siri will be used it may be on, with \"Listen for\" Off and a keyboard shortcut selected. Note: Currently this recommendation cannot be disabled either globally with a profile or individually with a plist change, but only through the GUI. Due to this, we are moving this recommendation to be manual (but still disabled) and disabling Siri until it is possible to disable Listen for through a non-GUI method."
     rationale: "In most environments there is too much unbounded risk of data spillage with a microphone always on, listening for instruction, and listening for questions if attention is obtained, relying on cloud compute to answer them. There are many examples of data leakage for technology in this space, and future vulnerabilities and bugs are certainly possible."
     impact: "Siri will not be available for hands-free usage, or not available at all if turned off completely."
     remediation: "Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.Siri 2. The key to include is set to VoiceTriggerUserEnabled 3. The key must be set to <false/> Note: After testing, this profile will disable Hey Siri only for the first input but not additional inputs. This issues seems to only occur using the Apple Studio Display (and possibly the Pro Display XDR, but no testing has occurred with that device) and it is not the primary input source. We are going to continue testing, but this seems to be an edge case."

IT systems and devices, including their users, are subject to continuous exploit attempts. Most of that activity is not from an advanced attacker and can be considered background noise to a patched, hardened device. Advanced attackers are of more concern and a risk review to understand organizational targets and use Lockdown Mode where appropriate is necessary."

     description: "Universal Control is an Apple feature that allows Mac users to control multiple other Macs and iPads with the same keyboard, mouse, and trackpad using the same Apple Account. The technology relies on already available iCloud services, particularly Handoff. Universal Control simplifies the use of iCloud connectivity of multiple computers using the same Apple Account. This may simplify data transfer from organizationally-managed and personal devices. The use of the same iCloud account and Handoff is the underlying concern that should be evaluated. The use of the same keyboard or mouse across multiple devices does not by itself decrease organizational security. Universal Clipboard, a feature of Universal Control, allows any device using the same Apple Account to access the clipboard of any other devices using the same Apple Account."
     rationale: "The use of devices together when some are organizational and some are not may complicate device management standards. Universal control settings may also enable a user to share their clipboard across multiple devices authenticated to the same Apple Account, so disabling that should be discussed by the organization."

     title: "Ensure the OS Is Not Active When Resuming from Standby (Intel)."
     description: "In order to use a computer with Full Disk Encryption (FDE), macOS must keep encryption keys in memory to allow the use of the disk that has been FileVault protected. The storage volume has been unlocked and acts as if it were not encrypted. When the system is not in use, the volume is protected through encryption. When the system is sleeping and available to quickly resume, the encryption keys remain in memory. https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2018/08/20/laptop-sleep-security/ Mac systems should be set to hibernate after sleeping for a risk-acceptable time period. The default value for \"standbydelay\" is three hours (10800 seconds). This value is likely appropriate for most desktops. If Mac desktops are deployed in unmonitored, less physically secure areas with confidential data, this value might be adjusted. The desktop would have to retain power, however, so that the running OS or physical RAM could be attacked. MacBooks should be set so that the standbydelay is 15 minutes (900 seconds) or less. This setting should allow laptop users in most cases to stay within physically secured areas while going to a conference room, auditorium, or other internal location without having to unlock the encryption. When the user goes home at night, the laptop will auto-hibernate after 15 minutes and require the FileVault password to unlock prior to logging back into the system when it resumes. MacBooks should also be set to a hibernate mode that removes power from the RAM. This will stop the possibility of cold boot attacks on the system. Macs running Apple silicon chips, rather than Intel chips, do not require the same configuration as Intel-based Macs."
     rationale: "To mitigate the risk of data loss, the system should power down and lock the encrypted drive after a specified time. Laptops should hibernate 15 minutes or less after sleeping."
     impact: "The laptop will take additional time to resume normal operation if only sleeping rather than hibernating. Setting hibernatemode to 25 will disable the \"always-on\" feature of the Apple Silicon Macs. Internal Only - General."
     remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to set the hibernate delays and to ensure the FileVault keys are set to be destroyed on standby: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a standbydelaylow <value≤900> % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a standbydelayhigh <value≤900> % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a highstandbythreshold <value≥90> % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a hibernatemode 25 example: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a standbydelaylow 500 % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a standbydelayhigh 500 % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a highstandbythreshold 100 % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a destroyfvkeyonstandby 1 % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pmset -a hibernatemode 25."

     description: "Power Nap allows the system to stay in low power mode, especially while on battery power, and periodically connect to previously known networks with stored credentials for user applications to phone home and get updates. This capability requires FileVault to remain unlocked and the use of previously joined networks to be risk accepted based on the SSID without user input.

The presence of an electrical outlet does not completely correlate with logical and physical security of the device or available networks."
     rationale: "Disabling this feature mitigates the risk of an attacker remotely waking the system and gaining access. The use of Power Nap adds to the risk of compromised physical and logical security. The user should be able to decrypt FileVault and have the applications download what is required when the computer is actively used. The control to prevent computer sleep has been retired for this version of the Benchmark.

     description: "Password hints help the user recall their passwords for various systems and/or accounts. In most cases, password hints are simple and closely related to the user's password."
     rationale: "Password hints that are closely related to the user's password are a security vulnerability, especially in the social media age. Unauthorized users are more likely to guess a user's password if there is a password hint. The password hint is very susceptible to social engineering attacks and information exposure on social media networks."

  # 2.12.2 Audit Touch ID. (Manual)
   - id: 18567
     title: "Audit Touch ID."
     description: "Apple has integrated Touch ID with macOS and allows fingerprint use for many common operations. All use of Touch ID requires the presence of a password and the use of that password after every reboot, or when more than 48 hours has elapsed since the device was last unlocked. Touch ID is not a password replacement. The use of Touch ID can, however, make the use of passwords more secure for authorized users with physical access to a Mac. Normal day-to-day work operations can eliminate the use of console password entry unless a reboot is required other than on Monday morning. The infrequency of password screen unlock can enable a more complicated pass phrase that is seldom used. When Touch ID is used it remediates the risk of shoulder surfing (including video surveillance) to capture console credentials. There have been many reported shoulder surfing password captures on iOS devices. Reports have not been widespread on Macs, but shoulder surfing password capture is simpler than the other methods of breaking in to an encrypted Mac. When a SmartCard or YubiKey is provisioned by an organization and is available for Console authentication, that is a much more secure option than the use of Touch ID and is preferred."
     rationale: "Touch ID allows for an account-enrolled fingerprint to access a key that uses a previously provided password."
     impact: "Touch ID is more convenient for use with aggressive screen lock controls."

     rationale: "Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised. Depending on the governing authority, organizations can have vastly different auditing requirements. In this control we have selected a minimal set of audit flags that should be a part of any organizational requirements. The flags selected below may not adequately meet organizational requirements for users of this benchmark. The auditing checks for the flags proposed here will not impact additional flags that are selected. Internal Only - General."
     remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to set the required Security Auditing Flags: Edit the /etc/security/audit_control file and add aa, ad, -ex, -fm, -fr, -fw, and lo to flags. You can also substitute -all for -ex, -fm, -fr, and -fw."

     title: "Ensure install.log Is Retained for 365 or More Days and No Maximum Size."
     description: "macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization. The default value has an \"all_max\" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention, and a less precise rotation argument. The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year, and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year. While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag, the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired. Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information. man asl.conf - The maximum file size limitation string should be removed \"all_max=\" - An organization-appropriate retention should be added \"ttl=\" - The rotation should be set with timestamps \"rotate=utc\" or \"rotate=local\"."
     rationale: "Archiving and retaining install.log for at least a year is beneficial in the event of an incident as it will allow the user to view the various changes to the system along with the date and time they occurred."
     impact: "Without log files system maintenance and security, forensics cannot be properly performed. Internal Only - General."
     remediation: "Terminal Method: Perform the following to ensure that install logs are retained for at least 365 days: Edit the /etc/asl/com.apple.install file and add or modify the ttl value to 365 or greater on the file line. Also, remove the all_max= setting and value from the file line."

As part of defense-in-depth, the /etc/security/audit_control configuration and the files in /var/audit should be owned only by root with group wheel with read-only rights and no other access allowed. macOS ACLs should not be used for these files. The default folder for storing logs is /var/audit, but it can be changed. This recommendation will ensure that any target directory has appropriate access control in place even if the target directory is not the default of /var/audit."
     rationale: "Audit records should never be changed except by the system daemon posting events. Records may be viewed or extracts manipulated, but the authoritative files should be protected from unauthorized changes."
     impact: "This control is only checking the default configuration to ensure that unwanted access to audit records is not available. Internal Only - General."

If the system has different access controls on the audit logs, and the changes cannot be traced, a new install may be prudent. Check for signs of file tampering as well as unapproved OS changes. Note: In macOS 14, and versions going forward, Apple disabled auditd by default. Since that is the default, the /etc/security/audit_control does not exist. If this remediation is ran without copying the /etc/security/audit_control.example to /etc/security/audit_control then it can cause a recursive permissions issue and can cause an unsupported state (undesired results) and booting anomalies."

  # 3.6 Audit Software Inventory. (Manual)
   - id: 18581
     title: "Audit Software Inventory."
     description: "With the introduction of Mac OS X 10.6.6, Apple added a new application, App Store, which resides in the Applications directory. This application allows a user with admin privileges and an Apple Account to browse Apple's online App Store, purchase (including no-cost purchases), and install new applications, bypassing Enterprise software inventory controls. Any admin user can install software in the /Applications directory whether from internet downloads, thumb drives, optical media, cloud storage, or even binaries through email. Even standard users can run executables downloaded to their home folder by default. The source of the software is not nearly as important as a consistent audit of all installed software for patch compliance and appropriateness. A single user desktop where the user, administrator, and the person approving software are all the same person probably does not need to audit software inventory to this extent. It is helpful in the case of stability problems or malware, however. Scan systems on a monthly basis and determine the number of unauthorized pieces of software that are installed. Verify that if an unauthorized piece of software is found one month, it is removed from the system the next. Export System Information through the built-in System Information Application or other third-party tools on an organizationally defined timetable."
     rationale: "Part of comprehensive IT security involves device management and ensuring that all software is authorized and patched. Checking for macOS updates and app updates are relatively simple for the end user, and can even be updated with minimal privileges from trusted sources, if enabled. Remote monitoring of the patch status for software maintained through Apple is very well supported by management applications. Neither Apple capabilities nor third-party patch management solutions will cover all mission-necessary software for most organizations. Full visibility into software present on the system enables vulnerability and risk management. P.S. Don't forget about browser plugins/extensions for all installed software. Internal Only - General."

     rationale: "Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour's multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly-configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack.

This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices, the pf or other firewall would be needed."

     title: "Ensure Signed System Volume (SSV) Is Enabled."
     description: "Signed System Volume is a security feature introduced in macOS 11.0 Big Sur. During system installation, a SHA-256 cryptographic hash is calculated for all immutable system files and stored in a Merkle tree which itself is hashed as the Seal. Both are stored in the metadata of the snapshot created of the System volume. The seal is verified by the boot loader at startup. macOS will not boot if system files have been tampered with. If validation fails, the user will be instructed to reinstall the operating system. During read operations for files located in the Signed System Volume, a hash is calculated and compared to the value stored in the Merkle tree."
     rationale: "Running without Signed System Volume on a production system could run the risk of Apple software that integrates directly with macOS being modified."

  # 5.2.8 Ensure Password History Is Set to at least 24. (Automated)
   - id: 18599
     title: "Ensure Password History Is Set to at least 24."
     description: "Over time, passwords can be captured by third parties through mistakes, phishing attacks, third-party breaches, or merely brute-force attacks. To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed), users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes. Ensure that password history checks are part of the password policy on the computer. This control checks whether a new password is different than the previous 24. The latest NIST guidance based on exploit research referenced in this section details how one of the greatest risks is password exposure rather than password cracking. Passwords should be changed to a new unique value whenever a password might have been exposed to anyone other than the account holder. Attackers have maintained persistent control based on predictable password change patterns and substantially different patterns should be used in case of a leak."
     rationale: "Old passwords should not be reused."
     impact: "Required password changes will lead to some locked computers requiring admin assistance."
     remediation: "Terminal Method: Run the following command to require that the password must be different from at least the last 24 passwords: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy \"usingHistory=<value≥24>\" example: % /usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/pwpolicy -n /Local/Default -setglobalpolicy \"usingHistory=24\" Profile Method: Create or edit a configuration profile with the following information: 1. The PayloadType string is com.apple.mobiledevice.passwordpolicy 2. The key to include is pinHistory 3. The key must be set to <integer><value≥24></integer> Note: The profile method is the preferred method for setting password policy since - setglobalpolicy in pwpolicy is deprecated and will likely be removed in a future macOS release."

     description: "The sudo command allows the user to run programs as the root user. Working as the root user allows the user an extremely high level of configurability within the system. This control, along with the control to use a separate timestamp for each tty, limits the window where an unauthorized user, process, or attacker could utilize legitimate credentials that are valid for longer than required."
     rationale: "The sudo command stays logged in as the root user for five minutes before timing out and re-requesting a password. This five-minute window should be eliminated since it leaves the system extremely vulnerable. This is especially true if an exploit were to gain access to the system, since they would be able to make changes as a root user."

It is even more of an impact where users have to use sudo multiple times in quick succession as part of normal work processes. Organizations with that common use case will likely find this control too onerous and are better to accept the risk of not requiring a 0 grace period. In some ways the use of sudo -s, which is undesirable, is better than a long grace period since that use does change the hash to show that it is a root shell rather than a normal shell where sudo commands will be implemented without a password."

     title: "Audit Show All Filename Extensions."
     description: "A filename extension is a suffix added to a base filename that indicates the base filename's file format. This is intended for any user that logs into the GUI and has a home folder and not for service accounts. For the audit, we will continue to verify that every account with a home folder has filename extensions enabled. In macOS 15.0 Sequoia, the Show all filename extensions no longer worked consistently but does nominally default to showing all filename extensions. Due to this, the recommendation has been modified to audit this setting, but it is remaining in the benchmark as a good security practice to train users to verify that the file they are opening is the correct and expected filetype."
     rationale: "Visible filename extensions allow the user to identify the file type and the application it is associated with which leads to quick identification of misrepresented malicious files."
     impact: "The user of the system can open files of unknown or unexpected filetypes if the extension is not visible."
     remediation: "Graphical Method: Perform the following steps to ensure file extensions are shown: 1. Open Finder 2. Select Finder in the menu bar 3. Select Settings 4. Select Advanced 5. Set Show all filename extensions to enabled Internal Only - General Terminal Method: Run the following command to enable displaying of file extensions: % /usr/bin/sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true % /usr/bin/sudo killall Finder example: % /usr/bin/sudo -u seconduser /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/secondname/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true % /usr/bin/sudo killall Finder."

Part of the modern internet consists of vendors establishing a seemingly close relationship with as many users as possible to market to them, data-mine from them and sell their data to third-party data aggregators. AutoFill can be a method for a user to share too much information with untrusted website owners. Many security professionals advise disabling AutoFill to reduce the risk of over-sharing. These security professionals appear to believe that manual data entry is better, since completing the required forms are often the only method to connect to needed data.
