  # 1.6 Enable macOS update installs (Automated)
  - id: 17505
    title: "Enable macOS update installs"
    description: "Ensure that macOS updates are installed after they are available from Apple. This setting enables macOS updates to be automatically installed. Some environments will want to approve and test updates before they are delivered. It is best practice to test first where updates can and have caused disruptions to operations. Automatic updates should be turned off where changes are tightly controlled and there are mature testing and approval processes. Automatic updates should not be turned off so the admin can call the users first to let them know it's ok to install. A dependable repeatable process involving a patch agent or remote management tool should be in place before auto-updates are turned off."

  # 2.1.1 Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist (Automated)
  - id: 17506
    title: "Turn off Bluetooth, if no paired devices exist"
    description: "Bluetooth devices use a wireless communications system that replaces the cables used by other peripherals to connect to a system. It is by design a peer-to-peer network technology and typically lacks centralized administration and security enforcement infrastructure."
    rationale: "Bluetooth is particularly susceptible to a diverse set of security vulnerabilities involving identity detection, location tracking, denial of service, unintended control and access of data and voice channels, and unauthorized device control and data access."
    remediation: "Open a terminal session and enter the following command to disable bluetooth: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0 && sudo killall -HUP blued"

  - id: 17508
    title: 'Enable "Set time and date automatically"'
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes.  This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features."
    remediation: "Run the following commands: sudo systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver <timeserver>    sudo systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on"

  # 2.2.2 Ensure time set is within appropriate limits (Automated)
  - id: 17509
    title: "Ensure time set is within appropriate limits"
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds, for this audit a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time this check is not strict, it may be too great for your organization, adjust to a smaller offset value as needed. Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to ensure your time is set within an appropriate limit: sudo systemsetup -getnetworktimeserver -> Get the time server name and then run: sudo touch /var/db/ntp-kod && sudo chown root:wheel /var/db/ntp-kod && sudo sntp -sS <YOUR-TIME-SERVER> "

  # 2.3.1 Set an inactivity interval of 20 minutes or less for the screen saver (Automated)
  - id: 17510
    title: "Set an inactivity interval of 20 minutes or less for the screen saver"
    description: "A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS the screensaver starts after a value selected in a drop down menu, 10 minutes and 20 minutes are both options and either is acceptable. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts."
    rationale: "Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time."
    remediation: "Run the following command to verify that the idle time of the screen saver to 20 minutes or less (≤1200): sudo defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int 600 "

  # 2.3.2 Secure screen saver corners (Automated)
  - id: 17511
    title: "Secure screen saver corners"
    description: "Hot Corners can be configured to disable the screen saver by moving the mouse cursor to a corner of the screen."
    rationale: "Setting a hot corner to disable the screen saver poses a potential security risk since an unauthorized person could use this to bypass the login screen and gain access to the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command to turn off Disable Screen Saver for a Hot Corner: sudo -u <username> defaults write com.apple.dock <corner that is set to '6'> -int 0 "

  - id: 17514
    title: "Disable Screen Sharing"
    description: "Screen sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer’s screen. While sharing the computer’s screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer."
    rationale: "Disabling screen sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer."
    remediation: "Run the following command to turn off Screen Sharing: sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.screensharing.plist"

  # 2.4.4 Disable Printer Sharing (Automated)
  - id: 17515
    title: "Disable Printer Sharing"
    description: "By enabling Printer sharing the computer is set up as a print server to accept print jobs from other computers. Dedicated print servers or direct IP printing should be used instead."
    rationale: "Disabling Printer Sharing mitigates the risk of attackers attempting to exploit the print server to gain access to the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo cupsctl --no-share-printers"

  # 2.4.5 Disable Remote Login (Automated)
  - id: 17516
    title: "Disable Remote Login"
    description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
    rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most macOS computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off"

  # 2.4.9 Disable Remote Management (Automated)
  - id: 17520
    title: "Disable Remote Management"
    description: "Remote Management is the client portion of Apple Remote Desktop (ARD). Remote Management can be used by remote administrators to view the current Screen, install software, report on, and generally manage client Macs. The screen sharing options in Remote Management are identical to those in the Screen Sharing section. In fact, only one of the two can be configured. If Remote Management is used, refer to the Screen Sharing section above on issues regard screen sharing. Remote Management should only be enabled when a Directory is in place to manage the accounts with access. Computers will be available on port 5900 on a macOS System and could accept connections from untrusted hosts depending on the configuration, definitely a concern for mobile systems."
    rationale: "Remote management should only be enabled on trusted networks with strong user controls present in a Directory system. Mobile devices without strict controls are vulnerable to exploit and monitoring."

  # 2.4.10 Disable Content Caching (Automated)
  - id: 17521
    title: "Disable Content Caching"
    description: "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data."
    rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk they add to the management complexity, since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."

  # 2.4.11 Disable Media Sharing (Automated)
  - id: 17522
    title: "Disable Media Sharing"
    description: "Starting with macOS 10.15 Apple has provided a control to allow a user to share Apple downloaded content on all Apple devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID. This allows a user to share downloaded Movies, Music or TV shows with other controlled macOS, iOS and iPadOS devices as well as photos with Apple TVs. With this capability guest users can also use media downloaded on the computer. Best practice is not to use the computer as a server but to utilize Apple's cloud storage to download and use content stored there if content stored with Apple is used on multiple devices."

Users do not need to change the time or the time zone, the computer will do it for them. They do not need to specify their location for weather or travel times and even get alerts on travel times to meetings and appointment where location information is supplied. For the purpose of asset management and time and log management with mobile computers location services simplify some processes.There are some use cases where it is important that the computer not be able to report it's exact location. While the general use case is to enable Location Services, it should not be allowed if the physical location of the computer and the user should not be public knowledge."

  # 6.1.3 Disable guest account login (Automated)
  - id: 17564
    title: "Disable guest account login"
    description: "The guest account allows users access to the system without having to create an account or password. Guest users are unable to make setting changes, cannot remotely login to the system and all created files, caches, and passwords are deleted upon logging out."
    rationale: "Disabling the guest account mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly using privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow GuestEnabled - bool false"
    compliance:

  # 6.1.4 Disable "Allow guests to connect to shared folders" (Automated)
  - id: 17565
    title: 'Disable "Allow guests to connect to shared folders"'
    description: "Allowing guests to connect to shared folders enables users to access selected shared folders and their contents from different computers on a network."
    rationale: "Not allowing guests to connect to shared folders mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly use privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow GuestEnabled - bool false"

  # 6.1.5 Remove Guest home folder (Automated)
  - id: 17566
    title: "Remove Guest home folder"
    description: "In the previous two controls the guest account login has been disabled and sharing to guests has been disabled as well. There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed you have the option to archive it, leave it in place or delete. In the case of the guest folder the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders as well. Rather than ignoring the folders continued existence it is best removed."
    rationale: "The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately."
    remediation: "1. Run the following command in Terminal: sudo rm -R /Users/Guest  2. Make sure there is no output"

  # 6.2 Turn on filename extensions (Automated)
  - id: 17567
    title: "Turn on filename extensions"
    description: "A filename extension is a suffix added to a base filename that indicates the base filename's file format."
    rationale: "Visible filename extensions allows the user to identify the file type and the application it is associated with which leads to quick identification of misrepresented malicious files."
    remediation: "Perform the following to implement the prescribed state: 1. Select Finder 2. Select Preferences 3. Check Show all filename extensions    Alternatively, use the following command: defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true"
    compliance:

  # 6.3 Disable the automatic run of safe files in Safari (Automated)
  - id: 17568
    title: "Disable the automatic run of safe files in Safari"
    description: "Safari will automatically run or execute what it considers safe files. This can include installers and other files that execute on the operating system. Safari bases file safety by using a list of filetypes maintained by Apple. The list of files include text, image, video and archive formats that would be run in the context of the OS rather than the browser."
    rationale: "Hackers have taken advantage of this setting via drive-by attacks. These attacks occur when a user visits a legitimate website that has been corrupted. The user unknowingly downloads a malicious file either by closing an infected pop-up or hovering over a malicious banner. An attacker can create a malicious file that will fall within Safari's safe file list that will download and execute without user input."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to implement the prescribed state: 1. Open Safari 2. Select Safari from the menu bar 3. Select Preferences 4. Select General 5. Uncheck Open "safe" files after downloading    Alternatively run the following command in Terminal: defaults write com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -boolean no'
