  # 1.5 Enable OS X update installs (Scored)
  - id: 8504
    title: "Enable OS X update installs"
    description: "Ensure that OS X updates are installed after they are available from Apple. This setting enables OS X updates to be automatically installed. Some environments will want to approve and test updates before they are delivered. It is best practice to test first where updates can and have caused disruptions to operations. Automatic updates should be turned off where changes are tightly controlled and there are mature testing and approval processes. Automatic updates should not be turned off so the admin can call the users first to let them know it's ok to install. A dependable repeatable process involving a patch agent or remote management tool should be in place before auto-updates are turned off."
    rationale: "Patches need to be applied in a timely manner to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited"

  # 2.2.1 Enable "Set time and date automatically" (Not Scored)
  - id: 8505
    title: 'Enable "Set time and date automatically"'
    description: 'Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Apple''s automatic time update solution will enable an NTP server that is not controlled by the Application Firewall. Turning on "Set time and date automatically" allows other computers to connect to set their time and allows for exploit attempts against ntpd. It also allows for more accurate network detection and OS fingerprinting.'
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes.  This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features."
    remediation: "Run the following commands: sudo systemsetup -setnetworktimeserver <timeserver>    sudo systemsetup -setusingnetworktime on"

  # 2.2.3 Restrict NTP server to loopback interface (Scored)
  - id: 8506
    title: "Restrict NTP server to loopback interface"
    description: 'The Apple System Preference setting to "Set date and time automatically" enables both an NTP client that can synchronize the time from known time server(s) and an open listening NTP server that can be used by any other computer that can connect to port 123 on the time syncing computer. This open listening service can allow for both exploits of future NTP vulnerabilities and allow for open ports that can be used for fingerprinting to target exploits. Access to this port should be restricted.  Editing the /etc/ntp-restrict.conf file by adding a control on the loopback interface limits external access.'
    rationale: "Mobile workstations on untrusted networks should not have open listening services available to other nodes on the network."
    remediation: "1. Run the following command in Terminal:  sudo vim /etc/ntp-restrict.conf  2. Add the following lines to the file: restrict lo interface ignore wildcard interface listen lo"

  # 2.4.5 Disable Remote Login (Scored)
  - id: 8509
    title: "Disable Remote Login"
    description: "Remote Login allows an interactive terminal connection to a computer."
    rationale: "Disabling Remote Login mitigates the risk of an unauthorized person gaining access to the system via Secure Shell (SSH). While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple OSX clients, not servers."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin off"
    compliance:

  # 2.11 Java 6 is not the default Java runtime (Scored)
  - id: 8517
    title: "Java 6 is not the default Java runtime"
    description: "Apple had made Java part of the core Operating System for OS X. Apple is no longer providing Java updates for OS X and updated JREs and JDK are made available by Oracle.  The latest version of Java 6 made available by Apple has many unpatched vulnerabilities and should not be the default runtime for Java applets that request one from the Operating System"
    rationale: "Java is one of the most exploited environments and is no longer maintained by Apple, old versions may still be installed and should be removed from the computer or not be in the default path."
    remediation: "Java 6 can be removed completely or, if necessary Java applications will only work with Java 6, a custom path can be used."
    compliance:

  # 3.2 Enable security auditing (Scored)
  - id: 8518
    title: "Enable security auditing"
    description: "OSX's audit facility, auditd, receives notifications from the kernel when certain system calls, such as open, fork, and exit, are made. These notifications are captured and written to an audit log."
    rationale: "Logs generated by auditd may be useful when investigating a security incident as they may help reveal the vulnerable application and the actions taken by a malicious actor."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.auditd.plist"

  # 3.3 Configure Security Auditing Flags (Scored)
  - id: 8519
    title: "Configure Security Auditing Flags"
    description: "Auditing is the capture and maintenance of information about security-related events."
    rationale: "Maintaining an audit trail of system activity logs can help identify configuration errors, troubleshoot service disruptions, and analyze compromises or attacks that have occurred, have begun, or are about to begin. Audit logs are necessary to provide a trail of evidence in case the system or network is compromised."
    remediation: '1. Open a terminal session and edit the /etc/security/audit_control file 2. Find the line beginning with "flags" 3. Add the following flags: lo, ad, fd, fm, -all.  4. Save the file.'

  # 4.1 Disable Bonjour advertising service (Scored)
  - id: 8520
    title: "Disable Bonjour advertising service"
    description: "Bonjour is an auto-discovery mechanism for TCP/IP devices which enumerate devices and services within a local subnet. DNS on Mac OS X  is integrated with Bonjour and should not be turned off, but the Bonjour advertising service can be disabled."
    rationale: 'Bonjour can simplify device discovery from an internal rogue or compromised host. An attacker could use Bonjour''s multicast DNS feature to discover a vulnerable or poorly- configured service or additional information to aid a targeted attack. Implementing this control disables the continuous broadcasting of "I''m here!" messages. Typical end-user endpoints should not have to advertise services to other computers. This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices the pf or other firewall would be needed.'
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist NoMulticastAdvertisements"

    description: "Mac OS X used to have a graphical front-end to the embedded Apache web server in the Operating System. Personal web sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to download files or information from the user's computer. Personal web sharing from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. Apache however is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to share files and provide remote connectivity to an end user computer.  Web sharing should only be done through hardened web servers and appropriate cloud services."
    rationale: "Web serving should not be done from a user desktop. Dedicated webservers or appropriate cloud storage should be used. Open ports make it easier to exploit the computer."
    remediation: "Ensure that the Web Server is not running and is not set to start at boot    Stop the Web Server: sudo apachectl stop    Ensure that the web server will not auto-start at boot: sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd Disabled -bool true"

    description: "Mac OS X used to have a graphical front-end to the embedded ftp server in the Operating System. Ftp sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to download files or information from the user's computer. Running an Ftp server from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. The Ftp server however is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to share files and provide remote connectivity to an end user computer. Ftp servers meet a specialized need to distribute files without strong authentication and should only be done through hardened servers. Cloud services or other distribution methods should be considered"
    rationale: "Ftp servers should not be run on an end user desktop. Dedicated servers or appropriate cloud storage should be used. Open ports make it easier to exploit the computer."

    description: "Mac OS X can act as an NFS fileserver. NFS sharing could be enabled to allow someone on another computer to mount shares and gain access to information from the user's computer. File sharing from a user endpoint has long been considered questionable and Apple has removed that capability from the GUI. NFSD is still part of the Operating System and can be easily turned on to export shares and provide remote connectivity to an end user computer."
    rationale: "File serving should not be done from a user desktop, dedicated servers should be used.  Open ports make it easier to exploit the computer."

    description: "The root account is a superuser account that has access privileges to perform any actions and read/write to any file on the computer. In the UNIX/Linux world, the system administrator commonly uses the root account to perform administrative functions."
    rationale: "Enabling and using the root account puts the system at risk since any successful exploit or mistake while the root account is in use could have unlimited access privileges within the system. Using the sudo command allows users to perform functions as a root user while limiting and password protecting the access privileges.  By default the root account is not enabled on a Mac OS X client computer. It is enabled on Mac OS X Server. An administrator can escalate privileges using the sudo command (use -s or -i to get a root shell)."

    title: "Require a password to wake the computer from sleep or screen saver"
    description: "Sleep and screensaver modes are low power modes that reduces electrical consumption while the system is not in use."
    rationale: "Prompting for a password when waking from sleep or screensaver mode mitigates the threat of an unauthorized person gaining access to a system in the user's absence."
    remediation: "1. Run the following command in Terminal: The current user will need to log off and on for changes to take effect.  defaults write com.apple.screensaver askForPassword -int 1  2.  The current user will need to log off and on for changes to take effect."

  # 6.1.3 Disable guest account login (Scored)
  - id: 8529
    title: "Disable guest account login"
    description: "The guest account allows users access to the system without having to create an account or password. Guest users are unable to make setting changes, cannot remotely login to the system and all created files, caches, and passwords are deleted upon logging out."
    rationale: "Disabling the guest account mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly using privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following command in Terminal: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow GuestEnabled - bool NO"

  # 6.1.5 Remove Guest home folder (Scored)
  - id: 8530
    title: "Remove Guest home folder"
    description: "The guest account login should have been disabled, so there is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed you have the option to archive it, leave it in place or delete. In the case of the guest folder the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders as well. Rather than ignoring the folders continued existence it is best removed."
    rationale: "The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately."
    remediation: "1. Run the following command in Terminal: rm -R /Users/Guest  2. Make sure there is no output"

  # 6.2 Turn on filename extensions (Scored)
  - id: 8531
    title: "Turn on filename extensions"
    description: "A filename extension is a suffix added to a base filename that indicates the base filename's file format."
    rationale: "Visible filename extensions allows the user to identify the file type and the application it is associated with which leads to quick identification of misrepresented malicious files."
    remediation: "Perform the following to implement the prescribed state: 1. Select Finder 2. Select Preferences 3. Check Show all filename extensions    Alternatively, use the following command: defaults write NSGlobalDomain AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true"

  # 6.3 Disable the automatic run of safe files in Safari (Scored)
  - id: 8532
    title: "Disable the automatic run of safe files in Safari"
    description: "Safari will automatically run or execute what it considers safe files. This can include installers and other files that execute on the operating system. Safari bases file safety by using a list of filetypes maintained by Apple. The list of files include text, image, video and archive formats that would be run in the context of the OS rather than the browser."
    rationale: "Hackers have taken advantage of this setting via drive-by attacks. These attacks occur when a user visits a legitimate website that has been corrupted. The user unknowingly downloads a malicious file either by closing an infected pop-up or hovering over a malicious banner. An attacker can create a malicious file that will fall within Safari's safe file list that will download and execute without user input."
    remediation: 'Perform the following to implement the prescribed state: 1. Open Safari 2. Select Safari from the menu bar 3. Select Preferences 4. Select General 5. Uncheck Open "safe" files after downloading    Alternatively run the following command in Terminal: defaults write com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -boolean no'
