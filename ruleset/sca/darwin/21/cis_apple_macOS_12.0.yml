  # 2.1.1 Ensure Bluetooth Is Disabled If No Devices Are Paired (Automated)
  - id: 29006
    title: "Ensure Bluetooth Is Disabled If No Devices Are Paired."
    description: "Bluetooth devices use a wireless communications system that replaces the cables used by other peripherals to connect to a system. It is by design a peer-to-peer network technology and typically lacks centralized administration and security enforcement infrastructure."
    rationale: "Bluetooth is particularly susceptible to a diverse set of security vulnerabilities involving identity detection, location tracking, denial of service, unintended control and access of data and voice channels, and unauthorized device control and data access."
    remediation: "Open a terminal session and enter the following command to disable bluetooth: sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth ControllerPowerState -int 0 && sudo killall -HUP bluetoothd"

  # 2.2.2 Ensure time set is within appropriate limits (Automated)
  - id: 29009
    title: "Ensure time set is within appropriate limits."
    description: "Correct date and time settings are required for authentication protocols, file creation, modification dates and log entries. Ensure that time on the computer is within acceptable limits. Truly accurate time is measured within milliseconds. For this audit, a drift under four and a half minutes passes the control check. Since Kerberos is one of the important features of macOS integration into Directory systems the guidance here is to warn you before there could be an impact to operations. From the perspective of accurate time, this check is not strict, so it may be too great for your organization. Your organization can adjust to a smaller offset value as needed. Note: ntpdate has been deprecated with 10.14. sntp replaces that command. NOTE: set the correct network time server in the rules."
    rationale: "Kerberos may not operate correctly if the time on the Mac is off by more than 5 minutes. This in turn can affect Apple's single sign-on feature, Active Directory logons, and other features. Audit check is for more than 4 minutes and 30 seconds ahead or behind."

    title: "Ensure an Inactivity Interval of 20 Minutes Or Less for the Screen Saver Is Enabled."
    description: "A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS the screensaver starts after a value selected in a drop down menu, 10 minutes and 20 minutes are both options and either is acceptable. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts."
    rationale: "Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time."
    remediation: "Run the following command to verify that the idle time of the screen saver to 20 minutes or less (≤1200):  $ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int <value ≤1200>. If there are multiple users out of compliance with the prescribed setting, run this command for each user to set their idle time:  $ sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults -currentHost write com.apple.screensaver idleTime -int <value ≤1200>. Note: Issues arise if the command line is used to make the setting something other than what is available in the GUI Menu. Choose either 1 (60), 2 (120), 5 (300), 10 (600), or 20 (120) minutes to avoid any issues. Profile Method: 1.

While SSH is an industry standard to connect to posix servers, the scope of the benchmark is for Apple macOS clients, not servers. macOS does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. macOS no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple.

  - id: 29021
    title: "Ensure Content Caching Is Disabled."
    description: "Starting with 10.13 (macOS High Sierra) Apple introduced a service to make it easier to deploy data from Apple, including software updates, where there are bandwidth constraints to the Internet and fewer constraints and greater bandwidth on the local subnet. This capability can be very valuable for organizations that have throttled and possibly metered Internet connections. In heterogeneous enterprise networks with multiple subnets the effectiveness of this capability would be determined on how many Macs were on each subnet at the time new large updates were made available upstream. This capability requires the use of mac OS clients as P2P nodes for updated Apple content. Unless there is a business requirement to manage operational Internet connectivity bandwidth user endpoints should not store content and act as a cluster to provision data."
    rationale: "The main use case for Mac computers is as mobile user endpoints. P2P sharing services should not be enabled on laptops that are using untrusted networks. Content Caching can allow a computer to be a server for local nodes on an untrusted network. While there are certainly logical controls that could be used to mitigate risk they add to the management complexity, since the value of the service is in specific use cases organizations with the use case described above can accept risk as necessary."

    title: "Ensure AirDrop Is Disabled."
    description: "AirDrop is Apple's built-in on demand ad hoc file exchange system that is compatible with both macOS and iOS. It uses Bluetooth LE for discovery that limits connectivity to Mac or iOS users that are in close proximity. Depending on the setting it allows everyone or only Contacts to share files when they are nearby to each other. In many ways this technology is far superior to the alternatives. The file transfer is done over a TLS encrypted session, does not require any open ports that are required for file sharing, does not leave file copies on email servers or within cloud storage, and allows for the service to be mitigated so that only people already trusted and added to contacts can interact with you. While there are positives to AirDrop, there are privacy concerns that could expose personal information. For that reason, AirDrop should be disabled, and should only be enabled when needed and disabled afterwards."
    rationale: "AirDrop can allow malicious files to be downloaded from unknown sources. Contacts Only limits may expose personal information to devices in the same area."

    description: 'macOS writes information pertaining to system-related events to the file /var/log/install.log and has a configurable retention policy for this file. The default logging setting limits the file size of the logs and the maximum size for all logs. The default allows for an errant application to fill the log files and does not enforce sufficient log retention. The Benchmark recommends a value based on standard use cases. The value should align with local requirements within the organization. The default value has an "all_max" file limitation, no reference to a minimum retention and a less precise rotation argument. The all_max flag control will remove old log entries based only on the size of the log files. Log size can vary widely depending on how verbose installing applications are in their log entries. The decision here is to ensure that logs go back a year and depending on the applications a size restriction could compromise the ability to store a full year. While this Benchmark is not scoring for a rotation flag the default rotation is sequential rather than using a timestamp. Auditors may prefer timestamps in order to simply review specific dates where event information is desired. Please review the File Rotation section in the man page for more information. man asl.conf - The maximum file size limitation string should be removed "all_max=" - An organization appropriate retention should be added "ttl=" - The rotation should be set with timestamps "rotate=utc" or "rotate=local"'

This setting does not stop the computer from sending out service discovery messages when looking for services on an internal subnet, if the computer is looking for a printer or server and using service discovery. To block all Bonjour traffic except to approved devices the pf or other firewall would be needed.'

  # 6.1.4 Ensure Guest Access to Shared Folders Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 29061
    title: "Ensure Guest Access to Shared Folders Is Disabled."
    description: "Allowing guests to connect to shared folders enables users to access selected shared folders and their contents from different computers on a network."
    rationale: "Not allowing guests to connect to shared folders mitigates the risk of an untrusted user doing basic reconnaissance and possibly use privilege escalation attacks to take control of the system."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to verify that shared folders are not accessible to guest users: sudo /usr/bin/defaults write /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.smb.server AllowGuestAccess -bool false"

  # 6.1.5 Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist (Automated)
  - id: 29062
    title: "Ensure the Guest Home Folder Does Not Exist."
    description: "In the previous two controls the guest account login has been disabled and sharing to guests has been disabled as well. There is no need for the legacy Guest home folder to remain in the file system. When normal user accounts are removed you have the option to archive it, leave it in place or delete. In the case of the guest folder the folder remains in place without a GUI option to remove it. If at some point in the future a Guest account is needed it will be re-created. The presence of the Guest home folder can cause automated audits to fail when looking for compliant settings within all User folders as well. Rather than ignoring the folder's continued existence, it is best removed."
    rationale: "The Guest home folders are unneeded after the Guest account is disabled and could be used inappropriately."
    remediation: "Run the following command to remove the Guest user home folder: sudo /bin/rm -R /Users/Guest"

  # 6.2 Ensure Show All Filename Extensions Setting is Enabled (Automated)
  - id: 29063
    title: "Ensure Show All Filename Extensions Setting is Enabled."
    description: "A filename extension is a suffix added to a base filename that indicates the base filename's file format."
    rationale: "Visible filename extensions allow the user to identify the file type and the application it is associated with which leads to quick identification of misrepresented malicious files."
    remediation: "Run the following command to enable displaying of file extensions: sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/.GlobalPreferences.plist AppleShowAllExtensions -bool true"

  # 6.3 Ensure Automatic Opening of Safe Files in Safari Is Disabled (Automated)
  - id: 29064
    title: "Ensure Automatic Opening of Safe Files in Safari Is Disabled."
    description: "Safari will automatically run or execute what it considers safe files. This can include installers and other files that execute on the operating system. Safari bases file safety by using a list of filetypes maintained by Apple. The list of files include text, image, video and archive formats that would be run in the context of the OS rather than the browser."
    rationale: "Hackers have taken advantage of this setting via drive-by attacks. These attacks occur when a user visits a legitimate website that has been corrupted. The user unknowingly downloads a malicious file either by closing an infected pop-up or hovering over a malicious banner. An attacker can create a malicious file that will fall within Safari's safe file list that will download and execute without user input."
    remediation: "Run the following command to disable safe files from not opening in Safari: sudo -u <username> /usr/bin/defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Containers/com.apple.Safari/Data/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Safari AutoOpenSafeDownloads -bool false"
