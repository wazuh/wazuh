# 1.1.2 Filesystem Configuration
  - id: 1507 
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl umask tmp.mount; systemctl enable tmp.mount. Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount."

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated.

    rationale: "Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts."
