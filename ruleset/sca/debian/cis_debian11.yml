  # 1.1.2.1 Ensure /tmp is a separate partition (Automated)
  - id: 29500
    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in the relevant entry in /etc/fstab."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount. For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab or tmp.mount. Example of /etc/fstab configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 0. Example of tmp.mount configured tmpfs file system with specific mount options: [Unit] Description=Temporary Directory /tmp ConditionPathIsSymbolicLink=!/tmp DefaultDependencies=no Conflicts=umount.target Before=local-fs.target umount.target After=swap.target [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs."

  # 1.1.3.1 Ensure separate partition exists for /var (Automated)
  - id: 29504
    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var."
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follow. - Protection from resource exhaustion: The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. - Fine grained control over the mount: Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limits an attackers ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behaviour. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. - Protection from exploitation: An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    description: "A core dump is the memory of an executable program. It is generally used to determine why a program aborted. It can also be used to glean confidential information from a core file. The system provides the ability to set a soft limit for core dumps, but this can be overridden by the user."
    rationale: "Setting a hard limit on core dumps prevents users from overriding the soft variable. If core dumps are required, consider setting limits for user groups (see limits.conf(5) ). In addition, setting the fs.suid_dumpable variable to 0 will prevent setuid programs from dumping core."
    remediation: "Add the following line to /etc/security/limits.conf or a /etc/security/limits.d/* file: * hard core 0. Set the following parameter in /etc/sysctl.conf or a /etc/sysctl.d/* file: fs.suid_dumpable = 0. Run the following command to set the active kernel parameter: # sysctl -w fs.suid_dumpable=0.

  # 2.1.4.1 Ensure ntp access control is configured (Automated)
  - id: 29551
    title: "Ensure ntp access control is configured."
    description: 'ntp Access Control Commands: restrict address [mask mask] [ippeerlimit int] [flag ...]. The address argument expressed in dotted-quad form is the address of a host or network. Alternatively, the address argument can be a valid host DNS name. The mask argument expressed in dotted-quad form defaults to 255.255.255.255, meaning that the address is treated as the address of an individual host. A default entry (address 0.0.0.0, mask 0.0.0.0) is always included and is always the first entry in the list. Note: the text string default, with no mask option, may be used to indicate the default entry. The ippeerlimit directive limits the number of peer requests for each IP to int, where a value of -1 means "unlimited", the current default. A value of 0 means "none". There would usually be at most 1 peering request per IP, but if the remote peering requests are behind a proxy there could well be more than 1 per IP. In the current implementation, flag always restricts access, i.e., an entry with no flags indicates that free access to the server is to be given. The flags are not orthogonal, in that more restrictive flags will often make less restrictive ones redundant. The flags can generally be classed into two categories, those which restrict time service and those which restrict informational queries and attempts to do run-time reconfiguration of the server. One or more of the following flags may be specified: - kod - If this flag is set when an access violation occurs, a kiss-of-death (KoD) packet is sent. KoD packets are rate limited to no more than one per second. If another KoD packet occurs within one second after the last one, the packet is dropped. - limited - Deny service if the packet spacing violates the lower limits specified in the discard command. A history of clients is kept using the monitoring capability of ntpd. Thus, monitoring is always active as long as there is a restriction entry with the limited flag. - lowpriotrap - Declare traps set by matching hosts to be low priority. The number of traps a server can maintain is limited (the current limit is 3). Traps are usually assigned on a first come, first served basis, with later trap requestors being denied service. This flag modifies the assignment algorithm by allowing low priority traps to be overridden by later requests for normal priority traps. - noepeer - Deny ephemeral peer requests, even if they come from an authenticated source. Note that the ability to use a symmetric key for authentication may be restricted to one or more IPs or subnets via the third field of the ntp.keys file. This restriction is not enabled by default, to maintain backward compatibility. Expect noepeer to become the default in ntp-4.4. - nomodify - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries which attempt to modify the state of the server (i.e., run time reconfiguration). Queries which return information are permitted. - noquery - Deny ntpq and ntpdc queries. Time service is not affected. - nopeer - Deny unauthenticated packets which would result in mobilizing a new association. This includes broadcast and symmetric active packets when a configured association does not exist. It also includes pool associations, so if you want to use servers from a pool directive and also want to use nopeer by default, you''ll want a restrict source ... line as well that does not include the nopeer directive. - noserve - Deny all packets except ntpq and ntpdc queries. - notrap - Decline to provide mode 6 control message trap service to matching hosts. The trap service is a subsystem of the ntpq control message protocol which is intended for use by remote event logging programs. - notrust - Deny service unless the packet is cryptographically authenticated. - ntpport - This is actually a match algorithm modifier, rather than a restriction flag. Its presence causes the restriction entry to be matched only if the source port in the packet is the standard NTP UDP port (123). Both ntpport and non-ntpport may be specified. The ntpport is considered more specific and is sorted later in the list.'
    rationale: "If ntp is in use on the system, proper configuration is vital to ensuring time synchronization is accurate."
    remediation: "Add or edit restrict lines in /etc/ntp.conf to match the following: restrict -4 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery restrict -6 default kod nomodify notrap nopeer noquery OR If another time synchronization service is in use on the system, run the following command to remove ntp from the system: # apt purge ntp."

    title: "Ensure ntp is configured with authorized timeserver."
    description: 'The various modes are determined by the command keyword and the type of the required IP address. Addresses are classed by type as (s) a remote server or peer (IPv4 class A, B and C), (b) the broadcast address of a local interface, (m) a multicast address (IPv4 class D), or (r) a reference clock address (127.127.x.x). Note: That only those options applicable to each command are listed below. Use of options not listed may not be caught as an error, but may result in some weird and even destructive behavior. If the Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6 (RFC-2553) is detected, support for the IPv6 address family is generated in addition to the default support of the IPv4 address family. In a few cases, including the reslist billboard generated by ntpq or ntpdc, IPv6 addresses are automatically generated. IPv6 addresses can be identified by the presence of colons ":" in the address field. IPv6 addresses can be used almost everywhere where IPv4 addresses can be used, with the exception of reference clock addresses, which are always IPv4. Note: In contexts where a host name is expected, a -4 qualifier preceding the host name forces DNS resolution to the IPv4 namespace, while a -6 qualifier forces DNS resolution to the IPv6 namespace. See IPv6 references for the equivalent classes for that address family. - pool - For type s addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with a number of remote servers. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. - server - For type s and r addresses, this command mobilizes a persistent client mode association with the specified remote server or local radio clock. In this mode the local clock can synchronized to the remote server, but the remote server can never be synchronized to the local clock. This command should not be used for type b or m addresses.'

  # 2.2.15 Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode (Automated)
  - id: 29569
    title: "Ensure mail transfer agent is configured for local-only mode."
    description: "Mail Transfer Agents (MTA), such as sendmail and Postfix, are used to listen for incoming mail and transfer the messages to the appropriate user or mail server. If the system is not intended to be a mail server, it is recommended that the MTA be configured to only process local mail."
    rationale: "The software for all Mail Transfer Agents is complex and most have a long history of security issues. While it is important to ensure that the system can process local mail messages, it is not necessary to have the MTA's daemon listening on a port unless the server is intended to be a mail server that receives and processes mail from other systems. Note: This recommendation is designed around the postfix mail server. Depending on your environment you may have an alternative MTA installed such as exim4. If this is the case consult the documentation for your installed MTA to configure the recommended state."
    remediation: "Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf and add the following line to the RECEIVING MAIL section. If the line already exists, change it to look like the line below: inet_interfaces = loopback-only. Run the following command to restart postfix: # systemctl restart postfix."

    description: "Monitor the use of the mount system call. The mount (and umount ) system call controls the mounting and unmounting of file systems. The parameters below configure the system to create an audit record when the mount system call is used by a non-privileged user."
    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

  # 5.2.16 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled (Automated)
  - id: 29664
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameter as follows: AllowTcpForwarding no."

  # 5.2.22 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured (Automated)
  - id: 29670
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "NOTE: To clarify, the two settings described below is only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they where abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en-abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinately, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the parameters according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3."

The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has to run sudo. The policy may require that users authenticate themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If authentication is required, sudo will exit if the user's password is not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific."

    description: "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in a specific groups to execute su.

    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Note: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
    remediation: "Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."
