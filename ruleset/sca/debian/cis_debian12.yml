    title: "Ensure /tmp is a separate partition."
    description: 'The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. - IF - an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in systemd default unit file. Note: In an environment where the main system is diskless and connected to iSCSI, entries in /etc/fstab may not take precedence. /tmp can be configured to use tmpfs. tmpfs puts everything into the kernel internal caches and grows and shrinks to accommodate the files it contains and is able to swap unneeded pages out to swap space. It has maximum size limits which can be adjusted on the fly via mount -o remount. Since tmpfs lives completely in the page cache and on swap, all tmpfs pages will be shown as "Shmem" in /proc/meminfo and "Shared" in free. Notice that these counters also include shared memory. The most reliable way to get the count is using df and du. tmpfs has three mount options for sizing: - size: The limit of allocated bytes for this tmpfs instance. The default is half of your physical RAM without swap. If you oversize your tmpfs instances the machine will deadlock since the OOM handler will not be able to free that memory. - nr_blocks: The same as size, but in blocks of PAGE_SIZE. - nr_inodes: The maximum number of inodes for this instance. The default is half of the number of your physical RAM pages, or (on a machine with highmem) the number of lowmem RAM pages, whichever is the lower. These parameters accept a suffix k, m or g and can be changed on remount. The size parameter also accepts a suffix % to limit this tmpfs instance to that percentage of your physical RAM. The default, when neither size nor nr_blocks is specified, is size=50%.'
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hard link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard link would be broken, and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "By design files saved to /tmp should have no expectation of surviving a reboot of the system. tmpfs is ram based and all files stored to tmpfs will be lost when the system is rebooted. If files need to be persistent through a reboot, they should be saved to /var/tmp not /tmp. Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to tmpfs or a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a configuration where /tmp is not a separate file system it will essentially have the whole disk available, as the default installation only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp (as with tmpfs) will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. Another alternative is to create a dedicated partition for /tmp from a separate volume or disk. One of the downsides of a disk-based dedicated partition is that it will be slower than tmpfs which is RAM-based."
    remediation: "First ensure that systemd is correctly configured to ensure that /tmp will be mounted at boot time. # systemctl unmask tmp.mount For specific configuration requirements of the /tmp mount for your environment, modify /etc/fstab. Example of using tmpfs with specific mount options: tmpfs /tmp 0 tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=2G 0 Note: the size=2G is an example of setting a specific size for tmpfs. Example of using a volume or disk with specific mount options. The source location of the volume or disk will vary depending on your environment: <device> /tmp <fstype> defaults,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0."

    description: "The /home directory is used to support disk storage needs of local users."
    rationale: "The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /home directory contains user generated data, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /home and impact all local users. Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. In the case of /home options such as usrquota/grpquota may be considered to limit the impact that users can have on each other with regards to disk resource exhaustion. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. As /home contains user data, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /home. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var."
    description: "The /var directory is used by daemons and other system services to temporarily store dynamic data. Some directories created by these processes may be world-writable."
    rationale: "The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follows. The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and waiting for it to be updated. Once the program is updated, the hard-link can be broken and the attacker would have their own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

    title: "Ensure separate partition exists for /var/log/audit."
    description: "The auditing daemon, auditd, stores log data in the /var/log/audit directory."
    rationale: "The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log/audit directory contains the audit.log file which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/log/audit and cause auditd to trigger its space_left_action as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details. Configuring /var/log/audit as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options. As /var/log/audit contains audit logs, care should be taken to ensure the security and integrity of the data and mount point."
    impact: "Resizing filesystems is a common activity in cloud-hosted servers. Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations."
    remediation: "For new installations, during installation create a custom partition setup and specify a separate partition for /var/log/audit. For systems that were previously installed, create a new partition and configure /etc/fstab as appropriate."

  # 2.4.1.8 Ensure crontab is restricted to authorized users. (Automated)
  - id: 33105
    title: "Ensure crontab is restricted to authorized users."
    description: "crontab is the program used to install, deinstall, or list the tables used to drive the cron daemon. Each user can have their own crontab, and though these are files in /var/spool/cron/crontabs, they are not intended to be edited directly. If the /etc/cron.allow file exists, then you must be listed (one user per line) therein in order to be allowed to use this command. If the /etc/cron.allow file does not exist but the /etc/cron.deny file does exist, then you must not be listed in the /etc/cron.deny file in order to use this command. If neither of these files exists, then depending on site-dependent configuration parameters, only the super user will be allowed to use this command, or all users will be able to use this command. If both files exist then /etc/cron.allow takes precedence. Which means that /etc/cron.deny is not considered and your user must be listed in /etc/cron.allow in order to be able to use the crontab. Regardless of the existence of any of these files, the root administrative user is always allowed to setup a crontab. The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, must be either world-readable, or readable by group crontab. If they are not, then cron will deny access to all users until the permissions are fixed. There is one file for each user's crontab under the /var/spool/cron/crontabs directory. Users are not allowed to edit the files under that directory directly to ensure that only users allowed by the system to run periodic tasks can add them, and only syntactically correct crontabs will be written there. This is enforced by having the directory writable only by the crontab group and configuring crontab command with the setgid bid set for that specific group. Note: - Even though a given user is not listed in cron.allow, cron jobs can still be run as that user - The files /etc/cron.allow and /etc/cron.deny, if they exist, only controls administrative access to the crontab command for scheduling and modifying cron jobs."
    rationale: "On many systems, only the system administrator is authorized to schedule cron jobs. Using the cron.allow file to control who can run cron jobs enforces this policy. It is easier to manage an allow list than a deny list. In a deny list, you could potentially add a user ID to the system and forget to add it to the deny files."

    title: "Ensure at is restricted to authorized users."
    description: "at allows fairly complex time specifications, extending the POSIX.2 standard. It accepts times of the form HH:MM to run a job at a specific time of day. (If that time is already past, the next day is assumed.) You may also specify midnight, noon, or teatime (4pm) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with AM or PM for running in the morning or the evening. You can also say what day the job will be run, by giving a date in the form month-name day with an optional year, or giving a date of the form MMDD[CC]YY, MM/DD/[CC]YY, DD.MM.[CC]YY or [CC]YY-MM-DD. The specification of a date must follow the specification of the time of day. You can also give times like now + count time-units, where the time-units can be minutes, hours, days, or weeks and you can tell at to run the job today by suffixing the time with today and to run the job tomorrow by suffixing the time with tomorrow. The /etc/at.allow and /etc/at.deny files determine which user can submit commands for later execution via at or batch. The format of the files is a list of usernames, one on each line. Whitespace is not permitted. If the file /etc/at.allow exists, only usernames mentioned in it are allowed to use at. If /etc/at.allow does not exist, /etc/at.deny is checked, every username not mentioned in it is then allowed to use at. An empty /etc/at.deny means that every user may use at.

    description: "Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between devices over short distances. It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative to wire connections."
    rationale: "An attacker may be able to find a way to access or corrupt your data. One example of this type of activity is bluesnarfing, which refers to attackers using a Bluetooth connection to steal information off of your Bluetooth device. Also, viruses or other malicious code can take advantage of Bluetooth technology to infect other devices. If you are infected, your data may be corrupted, compromised, stolen, or lost."
    impact: "Many personal electronic devices (PEDs) use Bluetooth technology. For example, you may be able to operate your computer with a wireless keyboard. Disabling Bluetooth will prevent these devices from connecting to the system. There may be packages that are dependent on the bluez package. If the bluez package is removed, these dependent packages will be removed as well. Before removing the bluez package, review any dependent packages to determine if they are required on the system. -IF- a dependent package is required: stop and mask bluetooth.service leaving the bluez package installed."
    remediation: "Run the following commands to stop bluetooth.service, and remove the bluez package: # systemctl stop bluetooth.service # apt purge bluez - OR - - IF - the bluez package is required as a dependency: Run the following commands to stop and mask bluetooth.service: # systemctl stop bluetooth.service # systemctl mask bluetooth.service Note: A reboot may be required."

  # 5.1.7 Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured. (Automated)
  - id: 33160
    title: "Ensure sshd ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax are configured."
    description: "Note: To clarify, the two settings described below are only meant for idle connections from a protocol perspective and are not meant to check if the user is active or not. An idle user does not mean an idle connection. SSH does not and never had, intentionally, the capability to drop idle users. In SSH versions before 8.2p1 there was a bug that caused these values to behave in such a manner that they were abused to disconnect idle users. This bug has been resolved in 8.2p1 and thus it can no longer be abused disconnect idle users. The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of SSH sessions. Taken directly from man 5 sshd_config: - ClientAliveInterval Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd(8) will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax Sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd(8) receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. It is important to note that the use of client alive messages is very different from TCPKeepAlive. The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel and therefore will not be spoofable. The TCP keepalive option en‐abled by TCPKeepAlive is spoofable. The client alive mechanism is valuable when the client or server depend on knowing when a connection has become unresponsive. The default value is 3. If ClientAliveInterval is set to 15, and ClientAliveCountMax is left at the default, unresponsive SSH clients will be disconnected after approximately 45 seconds. Setting a zero ClientAliveCountMax disables connection termination."
    rationale: "In order to prevent resource exhaustion, appropriate values should be set for both ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax. Specifically, looking at the source code, ClientAliveCountMax must be greater than zero in order to utilize the ability of SSH to drop idle connections. If connections are allowed to stay open indefinitely, this can potentially be used as a DDOS attack or simple resource exhaustion could occur over unreliable networks. The example set here is a 45 second timeout. Consult your site policy for network timeouts and apply as appropriate."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax parameters above any Include and Match entries according to site policy. Example: ClientAliveInterval 15 ClientAliveCountMax 3 Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence, Match set statements withstanding. If Include locations are enabled, used, and order of precedence is understood in your environment, the entry may be created in a file in Include location."

    title: "Ensure sshd DisableForwarding is enabled."
    description: "The DisableForwarding parameter disables all forwarding features, including X11, ssh-agent(1), TCP and StreamLocal. This option overrides all other forwarding-related options and may simplify restricted configurations. - X11Forwarding provides the ability to tunnel X11 traffic through the connection to enable remote graphic connections. - ssh-agent is a program to hold private keys used for public key authentication. Through use of environment variables the agent can be located and automatically used for authentication when logging in to other machines using ssh. - SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Disable X11 forwarding unless there is an operational requirement to use X11 applications directly. There is a small risk that the remote X11 servers of users who are logged in via SSH with X11 forwarding could be compromised by other users on the X11 server. Note that even if X11 forwarding is disabled, users can always install their own forwarders. anyone with root privilege on the the intermediate server can make free use of ssh-agent to authenticate them to other servers Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and backdoors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments. In some environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to set the DisableForwarding parameter to yes above any Include entry as follows: DisableForwarding yes Note: First occurrence of a option takes precedence.

In the case of the latter, it may offer advice to the user on changing their password or, through the PAM_AUTHTOKEN_REQD return, delay giving service to the user until they have established a new password. The entries listed above are documented in the shadow(5) manual page. Should the user's record not contain one or more of these entries, the corresponding shadow check is not performed. The authentication component performs the task of checking the users credentials (password).

    description: 'The minimum password length setting determines the lowers number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps "passphrase" is a better term than "password". The minlen option sets the minimum acceptable size for the new password (plus one if credits are not disabled which is the default). Cannot be set to lower value than 6.'
    rationale: "Strong passwords help protect systems from password attacks. Types of password attacks include dictionary attacks, which attempt to use common words and phrases, and brute force attacks, which try every possible combination of characters. Also attackers may try to obtain the account database so they can use tools to discover the accounts and passwords."
    impact: "In general, it is true that longer passwords are better (harder to crack), but it is also true that forced password length requirements can cause user behavior that is predictable and undesirable. For example, requiring users to have a minimum 16-character password may cause them to choose repeating patterns like fourfourfourfour or passwordpassword that meet the requirement but aren’t hard to guess. Additionally, length requirements increase the chances that users will adopt other insecure practices, like writing them down, re-using them or storing them unencrypted in their documents. Having a reasonable minimum length with no maximum character limit increases the resulting average password length used (and therefore the strength).6."

It places an extra burden on users and many will use predictable patterns (for example, a capital letter in the first position, followed by lowercase letters, then one or two numbers, and a “special character” at the end).

    description: "The PASS_MAX_DAYS parameter in /etc/login.defs allows an administrator to force passwords to expire once they reach a defined age. PASS_MAX_DAYS <N> - The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction)."
    rationale: "The window of opportunity for an attacker to leverage compromised credentials or successfully compromise credentials via an online brute force attack is limited by the age of the password. Therefore, reducing the maximum age of a password also reduces an attacker's window of opportunity. We recommend a yearly password change. This is primarily because for all their good intentions users will share credentials across accounts. Therefore, even if a breach is publicly identified, the user may not see this notification, or forget they have an account on that site. This could leave a shared credential vulnerable indefinitely. Having an organizational policy of a 1-year (annual) password expiration is a reasonable compromise to mitigate this with minimal user burden."
    impact: "The password expiration must be greater than the minimum days between password changes or users will be unable to change their password. Excessive password expiration requirements do more harm than good, because these requirements make users select predictable passwords, composed of sequential words and numbers that are closely related to each other. In these cases, the next password can be predicted based on the previous one (incrementing a number used in the password for example). Also, password expiration requirements offer no containment benefits because attackers will often use credentials as soon as they compromise them. Instead, immediate password changes should be based on key events including, but not limited to: Indication of compromise - - Change of user roles - When a user leaves the organization. Not only does changing passwords every few weeks or months frustrate the user, but it’s also been suggested that it does more harm than good, because it could lead to bad practices by the user such as adding a character to the end of their existing password."

    description: "Record changes to network environment files or system calls. The below parameters monitors the following system calls, and write an audit event on system call exit: - sethostname - set the systems host name - setdomainname - set the systems domain name The files being monitored are: - /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net - messages displayed pre-login - /etc/hosts - file containing host names and associated IP addresses - /etc/networks - symbolic names for networks - /etc/network/ - directory containing network interface scripts and configurations files - /etc/netplan/ - central location for YAML networking configurations files."
    rationale: "Monitoring system events that change network environments, such as sethostname and setdomainname, helps identify unauthorized alterations to host and domain names, which could compromise security settings reliant on these names. Changes to /etc/hosts can signal unauthorized attempts to alter machine associations with IP addresses, potentially redirecting users and processes to unintended destinations. Surveillance of /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net is crucial to detect intruders inserting false information to deceive users. Monitoring /etc/network/ reveals modifications to network interfaces or scripts that may jeopardize system availability or security. Additionally, tracking changes in the /etc/netplan/ directory ensures swift detection of unauthorized adjustments to network configurations. All audit records should be appropriately tagged for relevance."

System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media.

Audit tools include custom queries and report generators. aide.conf is case-sensitive. Leading and trailing white spaces are ignored. Each config lines must end with new line. AIDE uses the backslash character () as escape character for ' ' (space), '@' and '' (backslash) (e.g. '\\ ' or '@'). To literally match a '' in a file path with a regular expression you have to escape the backslash twice (i.e. '\\\\'). There are three types of lines in aide.conf: - The configuration options which are used to set configuration parameters and define groups. (restricted) rules that are used to indicate which files are added to the database. - - Macro lines define or undefine variables within the config file. Note: Lines beginning with # are ignored as comments. @@include <FILE> - Include <FILE>. - The content of the file is used as if it were inserted in this part of the config file. - The maximum depth of nested includes is 16. `@@include <DIRECTORY> <REGEX> - [RULE_PREFIX] (added in AIDE v0.17) - Include all (regular) files found in <DIRECTORY> matching regular expression <REGEX> (sub-directories are ignored). - The file are included in lexical sort order. - If RULE_PREFIX is set, all rules included by the statement are prefixed with given <RULE_PREFIX> (added in AIDE v0.18).

    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable.

This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack.

The following script will: - remove excessive permissions on dot files within interactive users' home directories - change ownership of dot files within interactive users' home directories to the user - change group ownership of dot files within interactive users' home directories to the user's primary group list .forward and .rhost files to be investigated and manually deleted - #!/usr/bin/env bash { a_output2=(); a_output3=() l_maxsize=\"1000\" # Maximum number of local interactive users before warning (Default 1,000) l_valid_shells=\"^($( awk -F\\/ '$NF != \"nologin\" {print}' /etc/shells | sed -rn '/^\\//{s,/,\\\\\\\\/,g;p}' | paste -s -d '|' - ))$\" a_user_and_home=() # Create array with local users and their home directories while read -r l_local_user l_local_user_home; do # Populate array with users and user home location [[ -n \"$l_local_user\" && -n \"$l_local_user_home\" ]] && a_user_and_home+=(\"$l_local_user:$l_local_user_home\") done <<< \"$(awk -v pat=\"$l_valid_shells\" -F: '$(NF) ~ pat { print $1 \" \" $(NF-1) }' /etc/passwd)\" l_asize=\"${#a_user_and_home[@]}\" # Here if we want to look at number of users before proceeding [ \"${#a_user_and_home[@]}\" -gt \"$l_maxsize\" ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" ** INFO **\" \\ \" - \\\"$l_asize\\\" Local interactive users found on the system\" \\ \" - This may be a long running check\" \"\" file_access_fix() { a_access_out=() l_max=\"$( printf '%o' $(( 0777 & ~$l_mask)) )\" if [ $(( $l_mode & $l_mask )) -gt 0 ]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" is mode: \\\"$l_mode\\\" and should be mode: \\\"$l_max\\\" or more restrictive\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be mode: \\\"$l_max\\\" or more restrictive\" chmod \"$l_change\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi if [[ ! \"$l_owner\" =~ ($l_user) ]]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" owned by: \\\"$l_owner\\\" and should be owned by \\\"${l_user//|/ or }\\\"\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be owned by \\\"${l_user//|/ or }\\\"\" chown \"$l_user\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi if [[ ! \"$l_gowner\" =~ ($l_group) ]]; then printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" group owned by: \\\"$l_gowner\\\" and should be group owned by \\\"${l_group//|/ or }\\\"\" \\ \" Updating file: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" to be group owned by \\\"${l_group//|/ or }\\\"\" chgrp \"$l_group\" \"$l_hdfile\" fi } while IFS=: read -r l_user l_home; do a_dot_file=(); a_netrc=(); a_netrc_warn=(); a_bhout=(); a_hdirout=() if [ -d \"$l_home\" ]; then l_group=\"$(id -gn \"$l_user\" | xargs)\";l_group=\"${l_group// /|}\" while IFS= read -r -d $'\\0' l_hdfile; do while read -r l_mode l_owner l_gowner; do case \"$(basename \"$l_hdfile\")\" in .forward | .rhost ) a_dot_file+=(\" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" exists\" \" Please review and manually delete this file\") ;; .netrc ) l_mask='0177'; l_change=\"u-x,go-rwx\"; file_access_fix a_netrc_warn+=(\" - File: \\\"$l_hdfile\\\" exists\") ;; .bash_history ) l_mask='0177'; l_change=\"u-x,go-rwx\"; file_access_fix ;; * ) l_mask='0133'; l_change=\"u-x,go-wx\"; file_access_fix ;; esac done < <(stat -Lc '%#a %U %G' \"$l_hdfile\") done < <(find \"$l_home\" -xdev -type f -name '.*' -print0) fi [ \"${#a_dot_file[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && a_output2+=(\" - User: \\\"$l_user\\\" Home Directory: \\\"$l_home\\\"\" \"${a_dot_file[@]}\") [ \"${#a_netrc_warn[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && a_output3+=(\" - User: \\\"$l_user\\\" Home Directory: \\\"$l_home\\\"\" \"${a_netrc_warn[@]}\") done <<< \"$(printf '%s\\n' \"${a_user_and_home[@]}\")\" [ \"${#a_output3[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \" ** WARNING **\" \"${a_output3[@]}\" \"\" [ \"${#a_output2[@]}\" -gt 0 ] && printf '%s\\n' \"\" \"${a_output2[@]}\" }."
