    description: "The squashfs filesystem type is a compressed read-only Linux filesystem embedded in small footprint systems (similar to cramfs ). A squashfs image can be used without having to first decompress the image."
    rationale: "Removing support for unneeded filesystem types reduces the local attack surface of the system. If this filesystem type is not needed, disable it."
    impact: "Disabling squashfs will prevent the use of snap. Snap is a package manager for Linux for installing Snap packages. 'Snap' application packages of software are self-contained and work across a range of Linux distributions. This is unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or RPM, which require specifically adapted packages per Linux distribution on an application update and delay therefore application deployment from developers to their software's end-user. Snaps themselves have no dependency on any external store ('App store'), can be obtained from any source and can be therefore used for upstream software deployment. When snaps are deployed on versions of Linux, the Ubuntu app store is used as default back-end, but other stores can be enabled as well."

  # 1.1.2 Ensure /tmp is configured (Automated)
  - id: 33007
    title: "Ensure /tmp is configured."
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications. Notes: - If an entry for /tmp exists in /etc/fstab it will take precedence over entries in the tmp.mount file. - tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter in /etc/fstab or on the Options line in the tmp.mount file. If we don't specify the size, it will be half the RAM. Resize tmpfs examples: - /etc/fstab tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,noexec,nodev,nosuid,size=2G 0 0 - tmp.mount [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,size=2G,noexec,nodev,nosuid."
    rationale: "Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw. This can be accomplished by either mounting tmpfs to /tmp, or creating a separate partition for /tmp."
    impact: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. Running out of /tmp space is a problem regardless of what kind of filesystem lies under it, but in a default installation a disk-based /tmp will essentially have the whole disk available, as it only creates a single / partition. On the other hand, a RAM-based /tmp as with tmpfs will almost certainly be much smaller, which can lead to applications filling up the filesystem much more easily. /tmp utilizing tmpfs can be resized using the size={size} parameter on the Options line on the tmp.mount file."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate. Example: tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime 0 0 OR Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: Run the following command to create the tmp.mount file is the correct location: # cp -v /usr/share/systemd/tmp.mount /etc/systemd/system/ Edit /etc/systemd/system/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount: [Mount] What=tmpfs Where=/tmp Type=tmpfs Options=mode=1777,strictatime,nosuid,nodev,noexec Run the following command to reload the systemd daemon with the unpdated tmp.mount unit file: # systemctl daemon-reload Run the following command to enable and start tmp.mount # systemctl --now enable tmp.mount."

  # 1.5.2 Ensure bootloader password is set (Automated)
  - id: 33031
    title: "Ensure bootloader password is set."
    description: "Setting the boot loader password will require that anyone rebooting the system must enter a password before being able to set command line boot parameters. Notes: - This recommendation is designed around the grub bootloader, if LILO or another bootloader is in use in your environment enact equivalent settings. - Replace /boot/grub/grub.cfg with the appropriate grub configuration file for your environment."
    rationale: "Requiring a boot password upon execution of the boot loader will prevent an unauthorized user from entering boot parameters or changing the boot partition. This prevents users from weakening security (e.g. turning off AppArmor at boot time)."
    impact: "If password protection is enabled, only the designated superuser can edit a Grub 2 menu item by pressing 'e' or access the GRUB 2 command line by pressing 'c' If GRUB 2 is set up to boot automatically to a password-protected menu entry the user has no option to back out of the password prompt to select another menu entry. Holding the SHIFT key will not display the menu in this case. The user must enter the correct username and password. If unable, the configuration files will have to be edited via the LiveCD or other means to fix the problem You can add --unrestricted to the menu entries to allow the system to boot without entering a password. Password will still be required to edit menu items. More Information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Passwords."
    remediation: 'Create an encrypted password with grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2: # grub-mkpasswd-pbkdf2 Enter password: <password> Reenter password: <password> PBKDF2 hash of your password is <encrypted-password>. Add the following into a custom /etc/grub.d configuration file: cat <<EOF set superusers="<username>" password_pbkdf2 <username> <encrypted-password> EOF. The superuser/user information and password should not be contained in the /etc/grub.d/00_header file as this file could be overwritten in a package update. If there is a requirement to be able to boot/reboot without entering the password, edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux and add --unrestricted to the line CLASS= Example: CLASS="--class gnu-linux --class gnu --class os --unrestricted". Run the following command to update the grub2 configuration: # update-grub.'

  # 1.6.1 Ensure XD/NX support is enabled (Automated)
  - id: 33033
    title: "Ensure XD/NX support is enabled."
    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature. Note: Ensure your system supports the XD or NX bit and has PAE support before implementing this recommendation as this may prevent it from booting if these are not supported by your hardware."
    rationale: "Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system."
    remediation: "On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios."

  - id: 33041
    title: "Ensure message of the day is configured properly."
    description: "The contents of the /etc/motd file are displayed to users after login and function as a message of the day for authenticated users. Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information: \\m - machine architecture \\r - operating system release \\s - operating system name \\v - operating system version."
    rationale: "Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the \" uname -a \" command once they have logged in."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/motd file with the appropriate contents according to your site policy, remove any instances of \\m , \\r , \\s , \\v or references to the OS platform OR If the motd is not used, this file can be removed.

    title: "Ensure local login warning banner is configured properly."
    description: "The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed to users prior to login for local terminals. Unix-based systems have typically displayed information about the OS release and patch level upon logging in to the system. This information can be useful to developers who are developing software for a particular OS platform. If mingetty(8) supports the following options, they display operating system information: \\m - machine architecture \\r - operating system release \\s - operating system name \\v - operating system version - or the operating system's name."
    rationale: "Warning messages inform users who are attempting to login to the system of their legal status regarding the system and must include the name of the organization that owns the system and any monitoring policies that are in place. Displaying OS and patch level information in login banners also has the side effect of providing detailed system information to attackers attempting to target specific exploits of a system. Authorized users can easily get this information by running the \" uname -a \" command once they have logged in."

    title: "Ensure systemd-timesyncd is configured."
    description: "systemd-timesyncd is a daemon that has been added for synchronizing the system clock across the network. It implements an SNTP client. In contrast to NTP implementations such as chrony or the NTP reference server this only implements a client side, and does not bother with the full NTP complexity, focusing only on querying time from one remote server and synchronizing the local clock to it. The daemon runs with minimal privileges, and has been hooked up with networkd to only operate when network connectivity is available. The daemon saves the current clock to disk every time a new NTP sync has been acquired, and uses this to possibly correct the system clock early at bootup, in order to accommodate for systems that lack an RTC such as the Raspberry Pi and embedded devices, and make sure that time monotonically progresses on these systems, even if it is not always correct. To make use of this daemon a new system user and group \"systemd-timesync\" needs to be created on installation of systemd. Notes: - The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not covered by systemd-timesyncd - If chrony or ntp are used, systemd-timesyncd should be stopped and masked, and this section skipped - This recommendation only applies if timesyncd is in use on the system - Only one time synchronization method should be in use on the system."

Support for SNMPv2 classic (a.k.a. \"SNMPv2 historic\" - RFCs 1441-1452) was dropped with the 4.0 release of the UCD-snmp package. The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) server is used to listen for SNMP commands from an SNMP management system, execute the commands or collect the information and then send results back to the requesting system."

    title: "Ensure TCP SYN Cookies is enabled."
    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the system to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a system by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake.

    rationale: "It is highly unusual for a non privileged user to mount file systems to the system. While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open , creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

Notes: - Systems may have been customized to change the default UID_MIN.

    title: "Ensure journald is configured to send logs to rsyslog."
    description: "Data from journald may be stored in volatile memory or persisted locally on the server. Utilities exist to accept remote export of journald logs, however, use of the rsyslog service provides a consistent means of log collection and export. Notes: - This recommendation assumes that recommendation 4.2.1.5, \"Ensure rsyslog is configured to send logs to a remote log host\" has been implemented. - As noted in the journald man pages, journald logs may be exported to rsyslog either through the process mentioned here, or through a facility like systemd-journald.service. There are trade-offs involved in each implementation, where ForwardToSyslog will immediately capture all events (and forward to an external log server, if properly configured), but may not capture all boot-up activities. Mechanisms such as systemd-journald.service, on the other hand, will record bootup events, but may delay sending the information to rsyslog, leading to the potential for log manipulation prior to export. Be aware of the limitations of all tools employed to secure a system. - The main configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf is read before any of the custom *.conf files. If there are custom configs present, they override the main configuration parameters."
    rationale: "Storing log data on a remote host protects log integrity from local attacks. If an attacker gains root access on the local system, they could tamper with or remove log data that is stored on the local system."
    remediation: "Edit the /etc/systemd/journald.conf file and add the following line: ForwardToSyslog=yes."

  # 5.2.15 Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured. (Automated)
  - id: 33152
    title: "Ensure SSH Idle Timeout Interval is configured."
    description: "The two options ClientAliveInterval and ClientAliveCountMax control the timeout of ssh sessions. - ClientAliveInterval sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The default is 0, indicating that these messages will not be sent to the client. - ClientAliveCountMax sets the number of client alive messages which may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is reached while client alive messages are being sent, sshd will disconnect the client, terminating the session. The default value is 3. o The client alive messages are sent through the encrypted channel o Setting ClientAliveCountMax to 0 disables connection termination Example: If the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time. Note: Local site policy may be more restrictive."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value reduces this risk. - The recommended ClientAliveInterval setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes) - The recommended ClientAliveCountMax setting is 3 - The ssh session would send three keep alive messages at 5 minute intervals. If no response is received after the third keep alive message, the ssh session would be terminated after 15 minutes."

  # 5.2.20 Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled. (Automated)
  - id: 33157
    title: "Ensure SSH AllowTcpForwarding is disabled."
    description: "SSH port forwarding is a mechanism in SSH for tunneling application ports from the client to the server, or servers to clients. It can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications, going through firewalls, and some system administrators and IT professionals use it for opening backdoors into the internal network from their home machines."
    rationale: "Leaving port forwarding enabled can expose the organization to security risks and back-doors. SSH connections are protected with strong encryption. This makes their contents invisible to most deployed network monitoring and traffic filtering solutions. This invisibility carries considerable risk potential if it is used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration. Cybercriminals or malware could exploit SSH to hide their unauthorized communications, or to exfiltrate stolen data from the target network."
    impact: "SSH tunnels are widely used in many corporate environments that employ mainframe systems as their application backends. In those environments the applications themselves may have very limited native support for security. By utilizing tunneling, compliance with SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and other standards can be achieved without having to modify the applications."

    description: "Lock out users after n unsuccessful consecutive login attempts. The first sets of changes are made to the PAM configuration files. The second set of changes are applied to the program specific PAM configuration file. The second set of changes must be applied to each program that will lock out users. Check the documentation for each secondary program for instructions on how to configure them to work with PAM. - deny=n - n represents the number of failed attempts before the account is locked - unlock_time=n - n represents the number of seconds before the account is unlocked - audit - Will log the user name into the system log if the user is not found. - silent - Don't print informative messages. Set the lockout number and unlock time in accordance with local site policy. Notes: - Add pam_tally2 to the account section account required pam_tally2.so for the counter to reset to 0 when using sudo - Use of the \"audit\" keyword may log credentials in the case of user error during - authentication. This risk should be evaluated in the context of the site policies of your organization. If a user has been locked out because they have reached the maximum consecutive failure count defined by deny= in the pam_tally2.so module, the user can be unlocked by issuing the command /sbin/pam_tally2 -u <username> --reset. This command sets the failed count to 0, effectively unlocking the user."

  # 6.2.1 Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords. (Automated)
  - id: 33178
    title: "Ensure accounts in /etc/passwd use shadowed passwords."
    description: "Local accounts can uses shadowed passwords. With shadowed passwords, The passwords are saved in shadow password file, /etc/shadow, encrypted by a salted one-way hash. Accounts with a shadowed password have an x in the second field in /etc/passwd."
    rationale: "The /etc/passwd file also contains information like user ID's and group ID's that are used by many system programs. Therefore, the /etc/passwd file must remain world readable. In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, an attacker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. This can be mitigated by using shadowed passwords, thus moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to /etc/shadow. The /etc/shadow file is set so only root will be able to read and write. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker gaining access to the encoded passwords with which to perform a dictionary attack. Notes: - All accounts must have passwords or be locked to prevent the account from being used by an unauthorized user. - A user account with an empty second field in /etc/passwd allows the account to be logged into by providing only the username."
    remediation: "Run the following command to set accounts to use shadowed passwords: # sed -e 's/^\\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\\):[^:]*:/\\1:x:/' -i /etc/passwd Investigate to determine if the account is logged in and what it is being used for, to determine if it needs to be forced off."
