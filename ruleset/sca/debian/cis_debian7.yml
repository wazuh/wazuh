  # 2 Filesystem Configuration

  - id: 1000
    title: "Create Separate Partition for /tmp"
    description: "The /tmp directory is a world-writable directory used for temporary storage by all users and some applications."
    rationale: "Since the /tmp directory is intended to be world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion if it is not bound to a separate partition. In addition, making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set the noexec option on the mount, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code. It would also prevent an attacker from establishing a hardlink to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hardlink would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw."
    remediation: "Configure /etc/fstab as appropriate or Run the following commands to enable systemd /tmp mounting: systemctl umask tmp.mount; systemctl enable tmp.mount. Edit /etc/systemd/system/local-fs.target.wants/tmp.mount to configure the /tmp mount."

    description: "The /var/tmp directory is normally a standalone directory in the /var file system. Binding /var/tmp to /tmp establishes an unbreakable link to /tmp that cannot be removed (even by the root user). It also allows /var/tmp to inherit the same mount options that /tmp owns, allowing /var/tmp to be protected in the same manner /tmp is protected. It will also prevent /var from filling up with temporary files as the contents of /var/tmp will actually reside in the file system containing /tmp."
    rationale: "All programs that use /var/tmp and /tmp to read/write temporary files will always be write to tmp file system, preventing a user from running the /var file system out of space or trying to perform operations that have been blocked in the /tmp filesystem."

    rationale: "There are two important reasons to ensure that data gathered by auditd is stored on a separate partition: protection against resource exhaustion (since the audit.log file can grow quite large) and protection of audit data. The audit daemon calculates how much free space is left and performs actions based on the results. If other processes (such as syslog) consume space in the same partition as auditd, it may not perform as desired."

    rationale: "Since the user partitions are not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot attempt to create block or character special devices.  Note: The actions in the item refer to the /home partition, which is the default user partition that is defined in many distributions. If you have created other user partitions, it is recommended that the Remediation and Audit steps be applied to these partitions as well."

  # 4.2 Enable XD/NX Support on 32-bit x86 Systems (Not Scored)
  - id: 1026
    title: "Enable XD/NX Support on 32-bit x86 Systems"
    description: "Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those platforms supports the feature."
    rationale: "Enabling any feature that can protect against buffer overflow attacks enhances the security of the system."
    remediation: "On 32 bit systems install a kernel with PAE support, no installation is required on 64 bit systems: If necessary configure your bootloader to load the new kernel and reboot the system. You may need to enable NX or XD support in your bios."

In contrast, non-source routed packets travel a path determined by routers in the network.

Assume this server was capable of routing packets to Internet routable addresses on one interface and private addresses on another interface. Assume that the private addresses were not routable to the Internet routable addresses and vice versa. Under normal routing circumstances, an attacker from the Internet routable addresses could not use the server as a way to reach the private address servers.

  - id: 1067
    title: "Enable RFC-recommended Source Route Validation"
    description: "Setting net.ipv4.conf.all.rp_filter and net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter to 1 forces the Linux kernel to utilize reverse path filtering on a received packet to determine if the packet was valid. Essentially, with reverse path filtering, if the return packet does not go out the same interface that the corresponding source packet came from, the packet is dropped (and logged if log_martians is set)."
    rationale: "Setting these flags is a good way to deter attackers from sending your server bogus packets that cannot be responded to. One instance where this feature breaks down is if asymmetrical routing is employed. This would occur when using dynamic routing protocols (bgp, ospf, etc) on your system.

  # 7.2.8 Enable TCP SYN Cookies (Scored)
  - id: 1068
    title: "Enable TCP SYN Cookies"
    description: "When tcp_syncookies is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the queue."
    rationale: "Attackers use SYN flood attacks to perform a denial of service attacked on a server by sending many SYN packets without completing the three way handshake. This will quickly use up slots in the kernel's half-open connection queue and prevent legitimate connections from succeeding. SYN cookies allow the server to keep accepting valid connections, even if under a denial of service attack."

While tracking mount commands gives the system administrator evidence that external media may have been mounted (based on a review of the source of the mount and confirming it's an external media type), it does not conclusively indicate that data was exported to the media. System administrators who wish to determine if data were exported, would also have to track successful open, creat and truncate system calls requiring write access to a file under the mount point of the external media file system. This could give a fair indication that a write occurred. The only way to truly prove it, would be to track successful writes to the external media. Tracking write system calls could quickly fill up the audit log and is not recommended. Recommendations on configuration options to track data export to media is beyond the scope of this document."

When the ClientAliveInterval variable is set, ssh sessions that have no activity for the specified length of time are terminated. When the ClientAliveCountMax variable is set, sshd will send client alive messages at every ClientAliveInterval interval. When the number of consecutive client alive messages are sent with no response from the client, the ssh session is terminated. For example, if the ClientAliveInterval is set to 15 seconds and the ClientAliveCountMax is set to 3, the client ssh session will be terminated after 45 seconds of idle time."
    rationale: "Having no timeout value associated with a connection could allow an unauthorized user access to another user's ssh session (e.g. user walks away from their computer and doesn't lock the screen). Setting a timeout value at least reduces the risk of this happening..  While the recommended setting is 300 seconds (5 minutes), set this timeout value based on site policy.

    title: "Restrict Access to the su Command"
    description: "The su command allows a user to run a command or shell as another user. The program has been superseded by sudo, which allows for more granular control over privileged access. Normally, the su command can be executed by any user. By uncommenting the pam_wheel.so statement in /etc/pam.d/su, the su command will only allow users in the wheel group to execute su."
    rationale: "Restricting the use of su, and using sudo in its place, provides system administrators better control of the escalation of user privileges to execute privileged commands. The sudo utility also provides a better logging and audit mechanism, as it can log each command executed via sudo, whereas su can only record that a user executed the su program."

    rationale: "Setting a very secure default value for umask ensures that users make a conscious choice about their file permissions. A default umask setting of 077 causes files and directories created by users to not be readable by any other user on the system. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.

    title: "Ensure shadow group is empty"
    description: "The shadow group allows system programs which require access the ability to read the /etc/shadow file. No users should be assigned to the shadow group."
    rationale: "Any users assigned to the shadow group would be granted read access to the /etc/shadow file. If attackers can gain read access to the /etc/shadow file, they can easily run a password cracking program against the hashed passwords to break them. Other security information that is stored in the /etc/shadow file (such as expiration) could also be useful to subvert additional user accounts."
    remediation: "Remove all users from the shadow group, and change the primary group of any users with shadow as their primary group."
