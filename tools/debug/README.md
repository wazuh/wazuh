# Debug Tools for Wazuh

This folder contains several Python scripts designed to help debug, analyze, and interact with Wazuh internals. Each script targets a specific aspect of Wazuh's operation, such as querying sockets, sending messages, or analyzing performance data.

## `csv-stat.py`

### Description

Analyzes CSV files generated by performance tests. Reports CPU and RSS statistics for a specified daemon/process.

### Usage

```sh
python3 csv-stat.py <DAEMON> <FILE>
```
- `<DAEMON>`: Name of the process to filter.
- `<FILE>`: Path to the CSV file.

## `queue-mitm.py`

### Description

Man-in-the-middle tool for the Wazuh queue socket. Intercepts and forwards messages between daemons and the main queue socket for debugging and analysis.

### Usage

```sh
python3 queue-mitm.py
```
- No arguments required.
- Restart Wazuh daemons after starting the tool.

## `sendmsg.py`

### Description

Sends messages to the main Wazuh queue (analysisd/agentd). Useful for testing message handling and queue operations.

### Usage

```sh
python3 sendmsg.py [-L] [message]
echo "msg" | python3 sendmsg.py
```
- `-L`: Send the message in a loop until interrupted.
- `message`: Message to send (`<id>:<location>:<log>` format).

## `socket-query.py`

### Description

Sends queries to Wazuh module control sockets and prints the response. Useful for interacting with module APIs.

### Usage

```sh
echo -n '{"command":"getconfig","parameters":{"section":"internal"}}' | python3 socket-query.py /var/ossec/queue/sockets/analysis
```
- First argument: Path to the Wazuh module control socket.
- Query is read from stdin.

### `wdb-query.py`

### Description

Performs concurrent queries to the Wazuh DB (WDB) using multiple workers. Reads queries from stdin and prints formatted responses.

### Usage

```sh
python3 wdb-query.py [WORKERS]
```
- `[WORKERS]`: Number of concurrent connections (default: 8).
- Queries are read from stdin, one per line.

## Notes

- All scripts require Python 3.
- Some scripts may require elevated permissions depending on socket/file access.
- Intended for debugging, development, and analysis purposes only.
