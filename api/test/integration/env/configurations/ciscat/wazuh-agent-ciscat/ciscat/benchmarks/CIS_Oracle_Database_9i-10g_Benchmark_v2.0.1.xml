        <xhtml:h3>Background.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>CIS provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials
            from the CIS website or elsewhere (“Products”) as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the
            Products (“Recommendations”) result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
            generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or
            improve the security of their networks, systems and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and
            adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a “quick fix” for anyone’s
            information security needs.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:h3>No representations, warranties and covenants.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>CIS makes no representations, warranties or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products
            or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software,
            hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness or completeness of any Product
            or Recommendation. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations “as is” and “as available” without representations,
            warranties or covenants of any kind.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:h3>User agreements.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization (“we”) agree and acknowledge that:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ol>
            <xhtml:li>No network, system, device, hardware, software or component can be made fully secure;</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations,
                even risks that result from CIS’s negligence or failure to perform;</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to
                adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades or
                bug fixes or to notify us if it chooses at it sole option to do so; and Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any
                liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect,
                incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
                damage to reputation, loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any
                computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against
                us from third parties) arising out of or in any way connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or
                Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without limitation any
                liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms,
                backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.</xhtml:li>
        </xhtml:ol>
        <xhtml:h3>Grant of limited rights.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these
            Agreed Terms of Use:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ol>
            <xhtml:li>Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each
                user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single computer;</xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc,
                .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation
                the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.</xhtml:li>
        </xhtml:ol>
        <xhtml:h3>Retention of intellectual property rights; limitations on distribution.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. We acknowledge
            and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all
            ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights not expressly
            granted to users in the preceding section entitled “Grant of limited rights.”</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Subject to the paragraph entitled “Special Rules” (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of
            certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree
            that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
            Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend,
            sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any
            component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without
            regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other
            proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of
            Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product
            or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any
            Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
            Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with
            a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of
            the activities listed in this paragraph.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>We hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees,
            authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers,
            and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations (“CIS
            Parties”) harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court
            costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
            paragraph, including without limitation CIS’s right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
            subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree
            that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:h3>Special rules.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>The distribution of the NSA Security Recommendations is subject to the terms of the NSA Legal Notice and the terms
            contained in the NSA Security Recommendations themselves (http://nsa2.www.conxion.com/cisco/notice.htm).</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS has created and will from time to time create special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations
            with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use
            with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only
            so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
            right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member’s own organization, whether by manual or electronic
            means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member’s membership
            arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:h3>Choice of law; jurisdiction; venue.</xhtml:h3>
        <xhtml:p>We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
            the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be
            filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of
            such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be
            unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and
            enforceability of any remaining provisions.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>We acknowledge and agree that we have read these Agreed Terms of Use in their entirety, understand them and agree to be
            bound by them in all respects.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h2>Introduction</xhtml:h2>
            <xhtml:p>This provisional document is derived from research conducted utilizing the Oracle 10g program, the Oracle’s Technology
                Network (otn.oracle.com), various published books and the Oracle 9i Database baseline document. The provisional status is
                based on the lack of sufficient informational resources for this newly released application. This document provides the
                necessary settings and procedures for the secure installation, setup, configuration, and operation of an Oracle 10g database
                environment. Targeted for newly established and/or deployed Oracle 10g database in Unix or Windows operating system
                platforms, it is for the use of DOE advanced Oracle Database Administrators. With the use of the settings and procedures in
                this document, an Oracle database may be secured from conventional “out of the box” threats. Recognizing the nature of
                security cannot and should not be limited to only the application, the scope of this document is not limited to only Oracle
                specific settings or configurations, but also addresses backups, archive logs, “best practices” processes and procedures
                that are applicable to general software and hardware security.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>New to the 10g baseline document is organization into chapters based on logical groupings. Within chapters, items are
                organized by level. All items function on layer 7, the Application layer of the OSI model, or, as in the case of many policy
                items, are not applicable to the OSI model. Therefore, groupings via the OSI model would not be relevant.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Applicable items were verified and tested against an Oracle 10g default install on both a default Windows 2000 Server
                and a Solaris 9 Unix machine. The Oracle version used was 10.0.1.2 install disks, patched up to 10.0.1.3. Where the default
                setting is less secure then the recommended setting a caution has been provided in the comment section below the separator
                bar or as a note below a chapter heading. Default installs for both the operating system and the database may differ
                dependent on versions and options installed so this is to be used as a general guide only. Unix settings should translate to
                other varieties of Unix, but were only tested against Solaris 9. If any differences are found, please contact the CIS team.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>This document is not intended as a guidance document. It is the minimum required means of diligence for the protection
                of an Oracle 10g database. For issues of guidance, the NSA guideline web site (http://www.nsa.gov/snac) and the DOE
                guideline resources web site (http://www.cisecurity.org/bench_oracle.html) each provide excellent guidance documents for
                both operating systems and specific applications.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Under the Level heading, scoring data has been temporarily included:<xhtml:br/>S – To be scored.<xhtml:br/>N – Not to
                be scored.<xhtml:br/>R – Reportable, but not to be scored.<xhtml:br/>This data, as well as this paragraph should be deleted
                when no longer necessary.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h2>Appendix C - FIPS140-2 Issues</xhtml:h2>
            <xhtml:p>User communities implementing an Oracle 10g database that are required to meet the FIPS140-2 standard of encryption are
                facing a unique problem. To set the Oracle 10g software to the FIPS140 standard requires the SQLNET.FIPS_140 setting be set
                to TRUE and in turn the SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER setting be set to DES|DES40. With the SQLNET_140 set to TRUE any
                setting other than DES|DES40 for the SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_SERVER may cause an error, but the DES or DES40 standard for
                encryption are at best weak standards and are already subject to several known compromises. See notes 5.02 and 5.03.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Even as DES is an accepted standard for legacy systems under current FIPS140-2 standards, if FIPS140 compliance is
                mandated and a stronger encryption standard is required, then a third party encryption system must be used.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Third party encryption resources for Oracle include:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:h2>Appendix D - Waivers and Exceptions</xhtml:h2>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Waiver or exception procedure</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>The goal for the waiver or exception to the baseline is not to exempt or negate security considerations, but rather
                    provide a means for the maintenance of the security standards outside of the mandated means.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Compensation for the waiver or exemption</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>The steps taken to compensate for the waiver or the exemption should equal or surpass the standard for security of
                    the affected element. Further, the compensation must not be in conflict with or any way jeopardize existing security
                    measures.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Documentation of the waiver or exception</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>Because security methodologies are both contextual and interrelated, a waiver or exception cannot exist in
                    isolation from the scope of other security methodologies and cannot be executed without at least the awareness and/or
                    understanding of all other security agents functioning under the same security hierarchy. Toward insuring all other
                    security agents are informed of the waiver or exception, detailed documentation of the waiver or exception should be
                    made and circulated. At a minimum the documentation should include a detailed description of the justification/s,
                    nature, scope, duration, and means of compensation for the waiver or exception.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Justification</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>By their nature, the justifications for waivers or exception cannot be predicted. Reasons might include situations
                    where compliance with the standard would adversely affect the accomplishment of the mission of the computer system, or
                    where compliance with the standard would cause a major financial impact on the operator, which is not offset by
                    concurrent or subsequent cost of a security breach.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Nature</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>The nature of the waiver or exception delineates where within the hierarchy of software, hardware, physical,
                    infrastructure, or personnel the exemption will be effected. If the deviation from the standards of the baseline is of a
                    scope to cover multiple elements, then the effect on each element must be documented.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:div>
            <xhtml:div>
                <xhtml:h3>Scope</xhtml:h3>
                <xhtml:p>The scope of the waiver or exception provides the range to which operating system/s, application/s, machine/s,
