    <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and
        materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process
        that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their
        networks, systems, and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for
        anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS. CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or
        the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability,
        timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.
        USER AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully
        secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even
        risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the
        Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us
        of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or
        otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of
        software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from
        third parties) arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including
        without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
        CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1. Except to the extent that we may have received additional
        authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component
        of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its
        entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. We acknowledge and
        agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS
        reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights." Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes
        of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or
        otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise
        transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or
        device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any
        component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a
        Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and
        specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We
        will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors,
        members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the
        creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs)
        incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
        defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party
        beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which
        CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS
        Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of
        Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is
        subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these
        Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be
        filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these Agreed
        Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
        BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

            <xhtml:p>Directories that are used for system-wide functions can be further protected by placing them on separate partitions. This provides protection for resource exhaustion and enables the use of mounting
                options that are applicable to the directory's intended use. User's data can be stored on separate partitions and have stricter mount options. A user partition is a filesystem that has been established
                for use by the users and does not contain software for system operations. The directives in this section are easier to perform during initial system installation. If the system is already installed, it is
                recommended that a full backup be performed before repartitioning the system.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
                <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> If you are repartitioning a system that has already been installed, make sure the data has been copied over to the new partition, unmount it and then remove the data
                from the directory that was in the old partition. Otherwise it will still consume space in the old partition that will be masked when the new filesystem is mounted. For example, if a system is in
                single-user mode with no filesystems mounted and the administrator adds a lot of data to the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span> directory, this data will still consume space in <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/</xhtml:span> once the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/tmp</xhtml:span> filesystem is mounted unless it is removed first.</xhtml:p>

                <xhtml:p>Recent processors in the x86 family support the ability to prevent code execution on a per memory page basis. Generically and on AMD processors, this ability is called No Execute (NX), while on
                    Intel processors it is called Execute Disable (XD). This ability can help prevent exploitation of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and should be activated whenever possible. Extra steps must be taken
                    to ensure that this protection is enabled, particularly on 32-bit x86 systems. Other processors, such as Itanium and POWER, have included such support since inception and the standard kernel for those
                    platforms supports the feature.</xhtml:p>

                        routers in the network. In some cases, systems may not be routable or reachable from some locations (e.g. private addresses vs. Internet routable), and so source routed packets would need to be

                    <xhtml:p>ICMP redirect messages are packets that convey routing information and tell your host (acting as a router) to send packets via an alternate path. It is a way of allowing an outside routing
                        device to update your system routing tables. By setting <xhtml:span class="inline_block">net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects </xhtml:span>to 0, the system will not accept any ICMP redirect
                        messages, and therefore, won't allow outsiders to update the system's routing tables.</xhtml:p>

                    <xhtml:p>When <xhtml:span class="inline_block">tcp_syncookies </xhtml:span>is set, the kernel will handle TCP SYN packets normally until the half-open connection queue is full, at which time, the SYN
                        cookie functionality kicks in. SYN cookies work by not using the SYN queue at all. Instead, the kernel simply replies to the SYN with a SYN|ACK, but will include a specially crafted TCP sequence
                        number that encodes the source and destination IP address and port number and the time the packet was sent. A legitimate connection would send the ACK packet of the three way handshake with the
                        specially crafted sequence number. This allows the server to verify that it has received a valid response to a SYN cookie and allow the connection, even though there is no corresponding SYN in the
                        queue.</xhtml:p>

        <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>The items in this section describe how to configure logging, log monitoring, and auditing, using tools included in most distributions.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It is recommended that <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rsyslog </xhtml:span>be used for logging (with <xhtml:span class="inline_block">logwatch </xhtml:span>providing summarization) and <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span> be used for auditing (with <xhtml:span class="inline_block">aureport </xhtml:span>providing summarization) to automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts
                and other suspicious system behavior.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server via an encrypted
                connection. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a system
                compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected system(s). If a log correlation system is deployed, configure it to process the logs described in this section.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) it is recommended that the time be synchronized among systems and
                devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. See the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ntpd(8)</xhtml:span> manual page for more information on configuring NTP.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It is important that all logs described in this section be monitored on a regular basis and correlated to determine trends. A seemingly innocuous entry in one log could be more significant when
                compared to an entry in another log.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>
                <xhtml:strong>Note on log file permissions:</xhtml:strong> There really isn't a "one size fits all" solution to the permissions on log files. Many sites utilize group permissions so that administrators
                who are in a defined security group, such as "wheel" do not have to elevate privileges to root in order to read log files. Also, if a third party log aggregation tool is used, it may need to have group
                permissions to read the log files, which is preferable to having it run setuid to root. Therefore, there are two remediation and audit steps for log file permissions. One is for systems that do not have a
                secured group method implemented that only permits root to read the log files (<xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:root 600</xhtml:span>). The other is for sites that do have such a setup and are
                designated as <xhtml:span class="inline_block">root:securegrp 640 </xhtml:span>where <xhtml:span class="inline_block">securegrp </xhtml:span>is the defined security group (in some cases <xhtml:span class="inline_block">wheel</xhtml:span>).</xhtml:p>

                <xhtml:p>System auditing, through <xhtml:span class="inline_block">auditd</xhtml:span>, allows system administrators to monitor their systems such that they can detect unauthorized access or modification
                    of data. By default, auditd will audit SELinux AVC denials, system logins, account modifications, and authentication events. Events will be logged to <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/var/log/audit/audit.log</xhtml:span>. The recording of these events will use a modest amount of disk space on a system. If significantly more events are captured, additional on system or off
                    system storage may need to be allocated.<xhtml:br/>
                    <xhtml:strong>Note:</xhtml:strong> For 64 bit systems that have arch as a rule parameter, you will need two rules: one for 64 bit and one for 32 bit systems. For 32 bit systems, only one rule is
                    needed.</xhtml:p>

                    <xhtml:p>When auditing, it is important to carefully configure the storage requirements for audit logs. By default, auditd will max out the log files at 5MB and retain only 4 copies of them. Older
                        versions will be deleted. It is possible on a system that the 20 MBs of audit logs may fill up the system causing loss of audit data. While the recommendations here provide guidance, check your
                        site policy for audit storage requirements.</xhtml:p>

                        recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBD) method. From that research, new Counter mode algorithms (as described in
