        <xhtml:p>TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Background.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools,
            software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from
            the CIS website or elsewhere (“Products”) as a public service to Internet users
            worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products (“Recommendations”) result from a
            consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic
            in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
            organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems,
            and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation
            to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a
            “quick fix” for anyone’s information security needs.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>No Representations, Warranties, or Covenants.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the
            positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or
            the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software,
            hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability,
            timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the
            Products and the Recommendations “as is” and “as available” without representations,
            warranties, or covenants of any kind. </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>User Agreements.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization (“We”)
            agree and acknowledge that:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:ol>
            <xhtml:li>

                    CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without
                    limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property,

            <xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:p>Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
                    Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all
                    such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without
                    limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:li>
        </xhtml:ol>
        <xhtml:p>Retention of Intellectual Property Rights; Limitations on Distribution.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by
            international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
            intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership
            rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS
            reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled
            “Grant of limited rights.”</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Subject to the paragraph entitled “Special Rules” (which includes a waiver, granted
            to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as
            we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not
            (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source
            code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii)
            distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise
            transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any
            Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server,
            newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such
            mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo,
            copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any
            component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed
            Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any
            Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
            Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a
            Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent
            on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii)
            represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool
            or other Product. We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities
            in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
            directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
            licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers,
            and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the
            Products or Recommendations (“CIS Parties”) harmless from and against any and all
            liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs)
            incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any
            violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS’s right, at
            our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this
            indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such
            claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our
            undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Special Rules.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members
            and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual
            relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use
            with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each
            CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing
            with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to
            distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member’s own organization,
            whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
            foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member’s membership arrangement with CIS
            and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Choice of Law; Jurisdiction; Venue</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
            construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law
            or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only
            in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If
            any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any
            reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the
            validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</xhtml:p>
