		- Implementation of the Script Check Engine (SCE) functionality originally developed in the OpenSCAP project.  The SCE bridges the 
		  gap between administrators executing home-grown scripts for assessment, and more standards-based assessment languages such as 
		  SCAP, XCCDF and OVAL.  The SCE allows construction of XCCDF <Rule> elements containing checks designed to execute a script, capture 
		  the output and exit value of the script, and evaluate/generate a <rule-result> for later examination.  CIS-CAT's implementation 
		  allows for the execution and evaluation of Windows Batch scripts, VBScripts, and PowerShell, along with Unix/Linux shell scripts.
		  Further information regarding SCE can be found here -- http://www.open-scap.org/features/other-standards/sce/
		  SCE Community content examples can be found here    -- https://github.com/OpenSCAP/sce-community-content

				- When using the CIS-CAT graphical user interface, a user may select
				  the "Add Another Benchmark" button, adding the currently selected
				  benchmark and profile to the assessment queue, and returning the 
				  user to the Benchmark Selection screen to repeat the process as needed.
				
				- When executing CIS-CAT using the command-line user interface, users may
				  utilize the "-f" command-line option (long version "--find").  This option 
				  first lists benchmarks available for assessment, allowing the user to then 
				  select a benchmark and profile.  Users are then presented with a question 
				  to "Add another assessment".  If the user answers yes, the available 
				  benchmark list is displayed again.  This process continues until the user 
				  answers no or elects to quit CIS-CAT.
				  
		- Automatic Inventory & Assessment Capabilities
			- Users may now execute multiple benchmark assessments in CIS-CAT, allowing the 
			  tool itself to select which benchmarks and profiles to assess.
				- When using the CIS-CAT graphical user interface, a user may select the 
				  Options -> Automatic Benchmark Selection & Assessment menu option to 
				  initiate the inventory of CIS benchmarks applicable to their target system.
				  Users are allowed to then select/de-select benchmarks to include in the 
				  assessment, configure interactive values, and select reporting options prior
				  to executing the benchmark assessment(s).
				  
				- When executing CIS-CAT using the command-line user interface, users may 
				  utilize the "-aa" command-line option (long version "--auto-assess").  This 
				  option invokes CIS-CAT's inventory process, collecting the applicable CIS 
				  benchmarks for assessment.  Users are also provided the "-l2" option to 
				  configure assessment of a "Level-2" profile, if one exists in each inventoried
				  benchmark.
			
		- Added "-D" command-line option to allow users to specify properties to use
		  during the assessment.  Properties can take the form of "interactive" parameter
		  IDs.  Values from user-supplied properties are used to eliminate the need for
		  user interactivity.  For more information, see the CIS-CAT User's Guide, in the
		  section entitled "Configuring Interactive Values".
		  
		- Fixed issue in command-line user interface (Null Pointer Exception) when interactive parameter
		  values are supplied via properties file.  Issue only applies to OVAL-based benchmarks.
		
		- Fixed issue in vulnerability assessment report generation when found
		  vulnerabilities reference multiple CVE's

				  notifies Windows users of a vulnerability in Group Policy Preferences which could allow 
				  elevation of privileges.  Once the appropriate patch has been installed on the various 
				  systems, scheduled tasks are no longer allowed to store passwords, because the password 
				  was stored insecurely.  The "Assessing Multiple Windows Targets" and "Using the CIS-CAT 
				  Dissolvable Agent" workflows have been modified to function appropriately when configured 
				  with a built-in system account whose credentials are not required to be stored as part of
				  the scheduled task.  Please see the applicable sections of the "CIS-CAT Users Guide" for 
				  full configuration details.

		  The CSV report option allows a user to export dashboard results to comma-separated
		  value format, which is then viewable with Excel.
		
		- XCCDF 1.2 Support
		  CIS-CAT has been enhanced to support assessments using version 1.2 of the eXtensible
		  Configuration Checklist Description Format.  XCCDF 1.2 represents the latest version
		  of the specification, and was used in the implementation of both the CIS MIT Kerberos 
		  1.10 benchmark v1.0.0 and the CIS Microsoft Internet Explorer 10 Benchmark v1.0.0.
		  
		- SCAP 1.2 Support (Beta)
		  CIS-CAT conforms to the specifications outlined by the Security Content Automation 
		  Protocol (SCAP), version 1.2, as outlined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-126 rev.2.
		  As part of the SCAP 1.2 protocol, CIS-CAT's assessment capabilities have been expanded
		  to include the consumption of source data stream collection XML files, and the generation
		  of well-formed SCAP result data streams.
		  
		  SCAP 1.2 support increases a CIS-CAT user's ability to consume standards-based configuration
		  content from CIS or any other standards-compliant provider. Additionally, SCAP 1.2 allows 
		  CIS-CAT users to incorporate CIS-CAT assessment results into any standards-based product.
		  
		  As is required by the SCAP 1.2 specifications, CIS-CAT implements/adheres to the following
		  language/enumeration standards:
		  	- The eXtensible Configuration Checklist Description Format (XCCDF) version 1.2, 
		  	- The Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL) version 5.10, 
		  	- Asset Identification version 1.1, 
		  	- Asset Reporting Format version 1.1, 
		  	- The Common Configuration Enumeration (CCE) version 5, 
		  	- The Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) versions 2.2 and 2.3.
		  
		  To exercise this capability, users may download the "SCAP 1.2 Content...using OVAL version 5.10"
		  resources from the NIST NVD National Checklist Program repository for the following Operating
		  Systems:
		  	- Microsoft Windows 7
		  	- Microsoft Windows XP
		  	- Microsoft Windows Vista
		  	- Microsoft Internet Explorer 7
		  	- Microsoft Internet Explorer 8
		  
		  Please refer to the CIS-CAT User's Guide for more information on executing assessments against
		  SCAP 1.2 compliant data stream collections.
		  
		  NOTE: Please note that SCAP 1.2 data stream collection assessments are currently in a Beta phase, 
		        and CIS welcomes any feedback our members would be willing to provide.
