   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">	BACKGROUND.
	The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.	Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.	The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.	Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.	The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
	NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
	CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of	the Products or the Recommendations.	CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.	USER AGREEMENTS.
	By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
	1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
	2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
	3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
	4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
	5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
	6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
	GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
	CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
	1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
	2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
	RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
	The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.	We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.	CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
	Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.	We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
	We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.	We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use.	SPECIAL RULES.
	CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.	Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
	CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.	Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
	CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
	We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.	If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
	BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

Automatic updates should be turned off where changes are tightly controlled and there are mature testing and approval processes. Automatic updates should not be turned off so the admin can call the users first to let them know it's ok to install.

               <xhtml:p>OS X does have an IP based firewall available (pf, ipfw has been deprecated) that is not enabled or configured. There are more details and links in section 7.5. OS X no longer has TCP Wrappers support built-in and does not have strong Brute-Force password guessing mitigations, or frequent patching of openssh by Apple. Most OS X computers are mobile workstations, managing IP based firewall rules on mobile devices can be very resource intensive. All of these factors can be parts of running a hardened SSH server.</xhtml:p>

                        <xhtml:p>The SSH server built-in to OS X should not be enabled on a standard user computer, particularly one that changes locations and IP addresses. A standard user that runs local applications including email, web browser and productivity tools should not use the same device as a server. There are Enterprise management tool-sets that do utilize SSH, if they are in use, the computer should be locked down to only respond to known trusted IP addresses and appropriate admin service accounts.</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:p>For OS X computers that are being used for specialized functions there are several options to harden the SSH server to protect against unauthorized access including brute force attacks. There are some basic criteria that need to be considered:</xhtml:p>
                        <xhtml:ul>
                           <xhtml:li>Do not open an SSH server to the internet without controls in place to mitigate SSH brute force attacks, this is particularly important for systems bound to Directory environments. It is great to have controls in place to protect the system but if they trigger after the user is already locked out of their account they are not optimal. If authorization happens after authentication directory accounts for users that don't even use the system can be locked out.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Do not use SSH key pairs when there is no insight to the security on the client system that will authenticate into the server with a private key. If an attacker gets access to the remote system and can find the key they may not need a password or a key logger to access the SSH server.</xhtml:li>
                           <xhtml:li>Detailed instructions on hardening an SSH server, if needed, are available in the CIS Linux Benchmarks but it is beyond the scope of this benchmark</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>Apple's File Sharing uses a combination of SMB (Windows sharing) and AFP (Mac sharing)</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Three common ways to share files using File Sharing are:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ol>
                  <xhtml:li>Apple File Protocol (AFP)<xhtml:br/>AFP automatically uses encrypted logins, so this method of sharing files is fairly secure. The entire hard disk is shared to administrator user accounts. Individual home folders are shared to their respective user accounts. Users' "Public" folders (and the "Drop Box" folder inside) are shared to any user account that has sharing access to the computer (i.e. anyone in the "staff" group, including the guest account if it is enabled).</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Server Message Block (SMB), Common Internet File System (CIFS)<xhtml:br/>When Windows (or possibly Linux) computers need to access file shared on a Mac, SMB/CIFS file sharing is commonly used. Apple warns that SMB sharing stores passwords is a less secure fashion than AFP sharing and anyone with system access can gain access to the password for that account. When sharing with SMB, each user that will access the Mac must have SMB enabled.</xhtml:li>
               </xhtml:ol>

               <xhtml:p>Apple's iCloud is a consumer oriented service that allows a user to store data as well as find, control and backup devices that are associated with their Apple ID (Apple account.) The use of iCloud on Enterprise devices should align with the acceptable use policy for devices that are managed as well as confidentiality requirements for data handled by the user. If iCloud is allowed the data that is copied to Apple servers will likely be duplicated on both personal as well as Enterprise devices.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>For many users the Enterprise email system may replace many of the available features in iCloud. If using either an Exchange or Google environment email, calendars, notes and contacts can sync to the official Enterprise repository and be available through multiple devices.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Depending on workplace requirements it may not be appropriate to intermingle Enterprise and personal bookmarks, photos and documents. Since the service allows every device associated with the users ID to synchronize and have access to the cloud storage the concern is not just about having sensitive data on Apple's servers but having that same data on the phone of the teenage son or daughter of an employee. The use of family sharing options can reduce the risk.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The remote connectivity of "Back to My Mac" relies on screen sharing that should already be turned off, if available the users Apple ID (personal?) can be used for remote access to the Enterprise computer rather than through Enterprise managed accounts.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Apple's iCloud is just one of many cloud based solutions being used for data synchronization across multiple platforms and it should be controlled consistently with other cloud services in your environment. Work with your employees and configure the access to best enable data protection for you mission.</xhtml:p>

The capability allows users to store passwords in either iOS or OS X for use in Safari on both platforms and other iOS integrated applications.  The most pervasive use is driven by iOS use rather than OS X. The passwords stored in an OS X keychain on an Enterprise managed computer could be stored in Apple's cloud and then be available on a personal computer using the same account. The stored passwords could be for organizational as well as for personal accounts.</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:p>One of the most important IT Operational concerns is to ensure that information is protected against loss or tampering. The purpose of the IT devices is to process the data after all. At one time the cost of IT equipment and the volume of the data might make the protection of the equipment itself more important, at this point the vast size of data archives and the lower cost of end user equipment makes data protection central to operational planning. Backup strategies are generally focused on ensuring that there are multiple copies of relevant versions of user files. The plan is that no single hardware or software loss or failure will result in major data loss.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple introduced Time Machine in 2007 as a simple to use built-in mechanism for users to ensure that their machine was backed up and if there was a mistake or loss information could be easily recovered. There are other solutions to ensure information is protected including several Enterprise solutions and simple drive or directory cloning.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>One of the most important security tools for data protection on MacOS is FileVault. With encryption in place it makes it difficult for an outside party to access your data if they get physical possession of the computer. One very large weakness in data protection with FileVault is the level of protection on backup volumes. If the internal drive is encrypted but the external backup volume that goes home in the same laptop bag is not it is self-defeating. Apple tries to make this mistake easily avoided by providing a checkbox to enable encryption when setting-up a time machine backup. Using this option does require some password management, particularly if a large drive is used with multiple computers. A unique complex password to unlock the drive can be stored in keychains on multiple systems for ease of use.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>While some portable drives may contain non-sensitive data and encryption may make interoperability with other systems difficult backup volumes should be protected just like boot volumes.</xhtml:p>

There are several principles that are part of best practices for a posix based system that are contained in this section, This section does not contain a complete list of every permission on an OS X System that might be problematic. Developers and use cases differ and what some admins long in the profession might consider a travesty a risk assessor steeped in BYOD trends may not give a second glance at. We are documenting here controls that should point out truly bad practices or anomalies that should be looked at and considered closely. Many of the controls are to mitigate the risk of privilege escalation attacks and data exposure to unauthorized parties.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>By default OS X allows all valid users into the top level of every other users home folder, and restricts access to the Apple default folders within. Another user on the same system can see you have a "Documents" folder but cannot see inside it. This configuration does work for personal file sharing but can expose user files to standard accounts on the system.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The best parallel for Enterprise environments is that everyone who has a Dropbox account can see everything that is at the top level but can't see your pictures, in the parallel with OS X they can see into every new Directory that is created because of the default permissions.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Home folders should be restricted to access only by the user. Sharing should be used on dedicated servers or cloud instances that are managing access controls.

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>The login keychain is a secure database store for passwords and certificates and is created for each user account on Mac OS X. The system software itself uses keychains for secure storage. Anyone with physical access to an unlocked keychain where the screen is also unlocked can copy all passwords in that keychain. Application access to the login keychain does not keep it unlocked. If you set Apple Mail to check for email every 10 minutes using the keychain for credentials and the keychain to lock every 15 minutes if inactive it will still cause the keychain to lock. The approach recommended here is that the login keychain be set to periodically lock when inactive to reduce the risk of password exposure or unauthorized use of credentials by a third party. The time period that an organization uses will depend on how great the use is of keychain aware applications. Organizations that use Firefox and Thunderbird will have a much different tolerance than those organization using keychain aware applications extensively.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:span>By default, the keychain for an account, especially a local account, have the same password as the account's logon password. It is possible to change the passwords on keychains to something different than the login password, and doing so would keep that keychain locked until needed after login. This is especially important when a smartcard is being used for console login. Keychains need to be protected by more than a pin in order to be secured and the default behavior with a smartcard will result in a pin for the login password. Individual keychain entries can have special ACLs to increase security as well.</xhtml:span>

         <xhtml:p>Account management is a central part of security for any computer system including OS X. General practices should be followed to ensure that all accounts on a system are still needed and that default accounts should be removed. Users with admin roles should have distinct accounts for Admin functions as well as day to day work where the passwords are different and known only by the user assigned to the account. Accounts with Elevated privileges should not be easily discerned from the account name from standard accounts.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>When any computer system is added to a Directory System there are additional controls available including user account management that are not available in a standalone computer. One of the drawbacks is the local computer is no longer in control of the accounts that can access or manage it if given permission. For OS X if the computer is in a Directory any standard user can now login to the computer at console which by default may be desirable or not depending on the use case. If an admin group is allowed to administer the local computer the membership of that group is controlled completely in the Directory.</xhtml:p>
         <xhtml:p>OS X computers connected to a Directory should be configured so that the risk is appropriate for the mission use of the computer. Only those accounts that require local authentication should be allowed, only required administrator accounts should be in the local administrator group. Authenticated Users for console access and Domain Admins for Administration may be too broad or too limited</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>With Safari 10 Apple has changed the model on how the built-in web browser handles Internet Plug-Ins. Instead of using a global approach where the Plug-in is either on or off for all sites the default decision is about allowing, not allowing, or allowing permanently for a specific site that is visited. Other browsers are moving to stop using Plug-ins altogether and insist on the use of HTML 5 for rich content. Only allowing Plug-in content from specific sites is a viable security option. In the Security Preferences, Plug-in settings it is possible to override the security feature and enable Plug-in content globally by Plug-in. With the controls planned in other MacOS browsers allowing content globally is likely to put Safari users more at risk than other browser users.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>There are three options for Internet Plug-ins with Safari 10 "When visiting other websites" Ask, Off or On. The on setting should not be used.</xhtml:p>

This feature can be very desirable for personal Macs or in a small business setting so that all purchased software through Apple's App Store is provisioned on all OS X Computers, just like iOS.

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>EFI is the software link between the motherboard hardware and the software operating system. EFI determines which partition or disk to load Mac OS X from, it also determines whether the user can enter single-user mode. The main reasons to set a firmware password have been protections against an alternative boot disk, protection against a passwordless root shell through single user mode and protection against firewire DMA attacks. In the past it was not difficult to reset the firmware password by removing RAM but it did make tampering slightly harder and having to remove RAM remediated memory scraping attacks through DMA. It has always been difficult to Manage the firmware password on OS X computers, though some tools did make it much easier.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Apple patched OS X in 10.7 to mitigate the DMA attacks and the use of FileVault 2 Full-Disk Encryption mitigates the risk of damage to the boot volume if an unauthorized user uses a different boot volume or uses Single User Mode. Apple's reliance on the recovery partition and the additional features it provides make controls that do not allow the user to boot into the recovery partition less attractive.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Starting in Late 2010 with the MacBook Air Apple has slowly updated the requirements to recover from a lost firmware password. Apple only supports taking the computer to an Apple authorized service provider. This change makes managing the firmware password effectively more critical if it is used. </xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Setting the firmware password may be good practice in some environments. We cannot recommend it as a standard security practice at this time.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Apple has a service that will allow a user that has turned it on to reset their login password by signing in to Apple with their Apple ID. This sounds like a service that needs to be explicitly turned off in an Enterprise environment. There are however many factors here.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>You cannot reset your password if the computer is using FileVault</xhtml:li>

            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>The main use case I see for disabling this service is where you are not using FileVault to encrypt the Mac but are using Firmware controls to limit boot options with local accounts. Otherwise the user has other options for resetting a password that are more time consuming but just as effective when they have physical access to the computer.</xhtml:p>
