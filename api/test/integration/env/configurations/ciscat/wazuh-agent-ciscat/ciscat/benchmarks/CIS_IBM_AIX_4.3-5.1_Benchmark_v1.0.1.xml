    BACKGROUND.
    
    The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.  Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.  The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.  Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.  The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
    
    NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
    
    CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of  the Products or the Recommendations.  CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.  
    
    USER AGREEMENTS.
    
    By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
    
    1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
    2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
    3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
    4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
    5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
    6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
    
    GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
    
    CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
    
    1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
    2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
    
    RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
    
    The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.  We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.  CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
    Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.  We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
    We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.  We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. 
    
    SPECIAL RULES.
    
    CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.  Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
    CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.  Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
    CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
    
    We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    
    BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.

      <xccdf:description> Discussion: Installing up-to-date vendor patches and developing a procedure for keeping up-to-date with
                vendor patches is critical for the security and reliability of the system. The vast majority of successful attacks on
                systems use exploits against known vulnerabilities that have patches available. Vendors will issue operating system updates
                when they become aware of security vulnerabilities and other serious functionality issues, but it is up to their customers
                to actually download and install these patches.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note that lppchk was designed to catch accidental breakage of software - it was not designed to resist
                intentional attack. lppchk -c checks only the size and checksums of files - it does not check file permissions. As a result,
                it will not notice a binary that is set-UID or set-GID that should not be, or a modified file that has been tailored to have
                the "correct" checksum. If lppchk -c reports an unexpected value, you do have a problem - the lack of errors does not
                guarantee that all is well. You may wish to consider installing packages such as TripWire or AIDE, which are designed to
                resist attempts to deceive it. Also - it is normal for lppchk -c to flag files that have been updated by an emergency fix,
                as those fixes are not packaged to update the LPP database.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> To check if a a specific LPP level is installed (for example, bos.rte.shell):<xhtml:br/><xhtml:code> # lslpp -L bos.rte.shell<xhtml:br/> Fileset Level State Type Description (Uninstaller)<xhtml:br/>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> OpenSSH is a popular free distribution of the standards-track SSH
                protocols, which allow secure encrypted network logins and file transfers. Compilation of OpenSSH is complicated by the fact
                that it is dependent upon several other freely-available software libraries which also need to be built before OpenSSH
                itself can be compiled. However, we feel it is necessary to put forth this extra effort in order to stay current with
                OpenSSH releases and patches. Additionally, pre-compiled versions are often not compiled with the options you might find
                necessary, such as Kerberos support. For more information on OpenSSH, see http://www.openssh.org.<xhtml:br/> If you feel
                that you need to use a pre-compiled package for OpenSSH, you have several options:<xhtml:br/> 1. An AIX version is supplied
                on the AIX Bonus Pack CD's.<xhtml:br/> 2. IBM maintains an installp image for AIX5L at
                http://publib16.boulder.ibm.com/doc_link/en_US/a_doc_lib/aixbman/security/openssh.htm. This site also includes instructions
                for compiling OpenSSH on AIX.<xhtml:br/> 3. Bull maintains a very large repository of Open Source software for AIX, and may
                be more current than the software on the Bonus Pack CD's. Bull's web site is http://www.bullfreeware.com/. Install and
                configure SSH using the IBM Redbook at http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246873.pdf, section 5.2.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> The settings in this section attempt to ensure safe defaults for both the client and the server. Specifically,
                both the ssh client and the sshd server are configured to use only SSH protocol 2, as security vulnerabilities have been
                found in the first SSH protocol. This may cause compatibility issues at sites still using the vulnerable SSH protocol 1
                these sites should endeavor to configure all systems to use only SSH protocol 2.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note: If you installed the SSH package in this step, there will be no -preCIS backup of the configuration files.
                If SSH was previously existing, the <xhtml:code>do-backup.ksh</xhtml:code> script will capture a backup of the configuration files.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note: Ensure sshd is working properly (including ability to start automatically on reboot) before proceeding
                with this Benchmark. Failure to do so could lock you out of your machine if <xhtml:code>sshd</xhtml:code> is not running and
                you disable <xhtml:code>telnetd</xhtml:code>.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> The stock <xhtml:code>/etc/inetd.conf</xhtml:code> file shipped with AIX
                contains many services which are rarely used, or which have more secure alternatives. Indeed, after enabling SSH (see Item
                1.3), it may be possible to completely do away with all inetd-based services, since SSH provides both a secure login
                mechanism and a means of transferring files to and from the system. Using the above commands effectively disables all
                inetd-based network services. You will need to re-enable any service you find absolutely necessary to your organization. By
                disabling all inetd-based services and only re-enabling what is necessary you avoid a common mistake of simply overlooking a
                service which may be vulnerable.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> We strongly recommend that you implement local procedures to ensure that unwanted services remain disabled. This
                will ensure that an operating system patch doesn't re-enable a service. <xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:div class="question"> Question: Is there a reason to allow unlimited network access to this server? If the answer to

        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> By limiting access to the server, you reduce your exposure to threats
                from attackers on remote systems. For Internet-connected servers that provide service to the whole Internet, limiting access
                may not make sense. Intranet servers, limited-access servers, and workstations should limit access to only authorized networks.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> TCP Wrappers allows the administrator to control who has access to various network services based on the IP
                address of the remote end of the connection. TCP Wrappers also provides logging information via Syslog about both successful
                and unsuccessful connections. TCP Wrappers are generally triggered out of <xhtml:code>/etc/inetd.conf</xhtml:code> but other
                options exist for "wrappering" non-inetd-based software (see the documentation provided with the source code release).<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> If you would rather download and compile TCP Wrappers instead of using the pre-compiled version, the source code
                is available at http://www.porcupine.org. <xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> IPv6 Note: The TCP Wrappers binary referenced above does not support IPv6. If you need IPv6 support, please see
                http://www-aix.gsi.de/~bio/DOCS/tcpwrapperinstall.html for instructions on compiling TCP Wrappers for IPv6 support.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Many daemons (SSH for example) are compiled with TCP Wrapper support, so you can use
                    <xhtml:code>/etc/hosts.allow</xhtml:code> and <xhtml:code>/etc/hosts.deny</xhtml:code> to limit SSH access to your systems.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> It is important to note that TCP wrappers looks at <xhtml:code>hosts.allow</xhtml:code> first, then
                    <xhtml:code>hosts.deny</xhtml:code>, and controls access based on the first match. If you omit entries in
                    <xhtml:code>hosts.allow</xhtml:code> and deny access to ALL in <xhtml:code>hosts.deny</xhtml:code>, you will block

        <xhtml:div class="question"> Question: Is there a mission-critical reason that requires users to access this system via
                    telnet, rather than the more secure SSH protocol? If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </xhtml:div>
        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code> uses an unencrypted network protocol, which means data from the login session (such as
                passwords and all other data transmitted during the session) can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network, and also that
                the session can be hijacked by outsiders to gain access to the remote system. SSH provides encrypted network logins and
                should be used instead. Sites that are already using Kerberos may take advantage of the various Kerberos-specific options to
                enable encryption and stronger authentication in the telnet daemon itself ("man telnetd" for more information).<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> To aid in the migration to SSH, there is a freely available SSH client for Windows called putty, which is
                available from Simon Tatham (see http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/). There are numerous commercially
                supported SSH clients as well - check to see if your Enterprise already has an Enterprise SSH client.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Some Enterprises are using telnet over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard solution is to use SSH.
                Configuring telnet over SSL is beyond the scope of a Level 1 Benchmark and will not be addressed here.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> It is understood that large Enterprises deeply entrenched in using <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code> may take
                considerable effort in migrating from <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code> to <xhtml:code>ssh</xhtml:code>, so
                <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code> may have to be enabled. When it can be disabled, disable <xhtml:code>telnetd</xhtml:code>
                and refresh <xhtml:code>initd</xhtml:code>. Note: Ensure you have tested an alternate remote access method for your servers
                before leaving <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code> disabled. Failure to do so may result in being denied remote
                access.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:div class="question"> Question: Is this machine an (anonymous) FTP server, or is there a mission-critical reason why
                    data must be transferred to and from this system via an FTP server, rather than sftp or scp? If the answer to this
                    question is yes, proceed with the actions below </xhtml:div>
        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> Like <xhtml:code>telnet</xhtml:code>, the FTP protocol is unencrypted,
                which means passwords and other data transmitted during the session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the
                FTP session itself can be hijacked by an external attacker. SSH provides two different encrypted file transfer mechanisms -
                scp and sftp - and should be used instead. Even if FTP is required because the local system is an anonymous FTP server,
                consider requiring non-anonymous users on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. For further information on
                restricting FTP access to the system, see section 7.2 below.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note: Any directory writable by an anonymous FTP server should have its own partition. This helps prevent an FTP
                server from filling a hard drive used by other services. <xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> To aid in the migration away from FTP, there are a number of freely available <xhtml:code>scp</xhtml:code> and
                    <xhtml:code>sftp</xhtml:code> client for Windows, such as WinSCP (available from
                http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php) for a Graphical interface to putty, and pscp, which is a part of the previously
                mentioned putty package.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Some Enterprises are using FTP over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard solution is to use SSH.

        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> It is possible to run a Unix system with the Sendmail daemon disabled
                and still allow users (and programs such as 'cron') on that system to send email out from that machine. Running Sendmail in
                "daemon mode" (with the -bd command-line option) is only required on machines that act as mail servers, receiving and
                processing email from other hosts on the network.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note that after disabling the -bd option on the local mail server on AIX 5L (or any system running Sendmail
                v8.12 or later) it is also necessary to modify the <xhtml:code>/etc/mail/submit.cf</xhtml:code> file. Find the line that
                reads "D{MTAHost}localhost" and change localhost to the name of some other local mail server for the organization. This will
                cause email generated on the local system to be relayed to that mail server for further processing and delivery.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/><xhtml:u>Closing AIX Sendmail Open Relay</xhtml:u><xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> The default behavior of Sendmail in AIX 4.3.3 allows open relaying - the mail server will accept and process
                mail sent from outside your organization to addresses that are also outside your organization. This defect is commonly used
                by "spammers" to send e-mail to thousands of addresses, all originating from your mail server. <xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Before enabling sendmail in daemon mode, the sendmail configuration file must be modified to prevent this misuse
                of your system. The above steps explain how to update the <xhtml:code>sendmail.cf</xhtml:code> configuration file. </xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> NFS is frequently exploited to gain unauthorized access to files and
                systems. Clearly there is no need to run the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. If the machine is
                an NFS server, the administrator should take reasonable precautions when exporting file systems, including restricting NFS
                access to a specific range of local IP addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" and "nosuid" where appropriate.
                Also, you must ensure that all of the UID/GID on the server and clients systems are unique. NFS file access is based on the
                UID/GID pair so if there are conflicting UID/GID pairs between the servers and clients, there is a possibility of
                unauthorized file access. You should also strongly consider using the AIX Secure NFS facility. This facility uses DES
                encryption and public key cryptography to identify users and servers.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:br/> Disabling these services in the System Resource Controller will disable
                a wide variety of infrequently used subsystems. The resources are made inoperative (rather than removed outright) so that
                the local administrator can easily "restore" any of these resources if they discover a mission-critical need for one of
                these services. Note also that vendor patches may restore some of the original entries in the System Resource Controller -
                it is always a good idea to check the System Resource Controller using lssrc -a for any resources that may have been added
                by the patch installation process. <xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services in
                particular, the services that are disabled. Rather than disabling and then re-enabling these services, experienced
                administrators may wish to simply disable only those services that they know are unnecessary for their systems.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

                instance, in inetd) does not require these daemons to be running unless you want to communicate with another machine using
                IPv6 - the IPv6-aware software works just fine in IPv4-only or standalone mode without these daemons.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

    <xccdf:description>
      <xhtml:p>The items in this section cover enabling various different forms of system
      logging in order to keep track of activity on the system. Tools such as Swatch
      (<xhtml:a href="http://www.oit.ucsb.edu/~eta/swatch/">http://www.oit.ucsb.edu/~eta/swatch</xhtml:a>), Logcheck (<xhtml:a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sentrytools/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sentrytools</xhtml:a>), and HP's IDS/9000 for
      HP-UX 11 (<xhtml:a href="http://www.software.hp.com/ISS_products_list.html">http://www.software.hp.com/ISS_products_list.html</xhtml:a>) can be used to
      automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system
      behavior. Note that Swatch and Logcheck are not officially supported by
      HP.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is
        also recommended that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure,
        centralized log server. Not only does centralized logging help sites correlate
        events that may be occurring on multiple systems, but having a second copy of the
        system log information may be critical after a system compromise where the attacker
        has modified the local log files on the affected system(s).</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Log centralization is typically done in HP-UX environments using the standard
        Unix Syslog capability, though HP also supports the more secure and robust
        Systlog-NG as part of the HP Distributed Systems Administration Utilities (DSAU),
        shipped with later updates of HP-UX 11i v2.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different
        systems (particularly after a security incident) experts recommend establishing some
        form of time synchronization among systems and devices connected to the local
        network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time
        Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. More information
        on NTP can be found at <xhtml:a href="http://www.ntp.org/">http://www.ntp.org</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:strong>Discussion:</xhtml:strong>
        <xhtml:br/> By default, AIX systems do not capture logging information sent to
                syslogd. This is unfortunate, since a great deal of important security-related information (successful and failed su
                attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc.) is sent via the LOG_AUTH channel. If this data is not logged,
                you don't have any way of knowing what is going on.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> The above action causes this information to be captured in the <xhtml:code>/var/adm/authlog</xhtml:code> file,
                which is only readable by the superuser. This file should be reviewed and archived on a regular basis. In addition, messages
                sent to syslog channels other than LOG_AUTH are sent to <xhtml:code>/var/adm/syslog</xhtml:code> (which should also be
                reviewed). Note: Some AIX administrators prefer to log syslog events to <xhtml:code>/var/log</xhtml:code> - if this is your
                preference, change the above script to reflect <xhtml:code>/var/log</xhtml:code> instead of

        <xhtml:br/> By default the system logging daemon, syslogd, listens for log messages
                from other systems on network port 514/udp. Unfortunately, the protocol used to transfer these messages does not include any
                form of authentication, so a malicious outsider could simply barrage the local system's Syslog port with spurious traffic
                either as a denial-of- service attack on the system, or to fill up the local system's logging file systems so that
                subsequent attacks will not be logged.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note that it is considered good practice to set up one or more machines as central "log servers" to aggregate
                log traffic from all machines at a site. However, unless a system is set up to be one of these "log server" systems, it
                should not be listening on 514/udp for incoming log messages.<xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:br/> When the so-called "sticky bit" is set on a directory, then only the
                owner of a file may remove that file from the directory (as opposed to the usual behavior where anybody with write access to
                that directory may remove the file). Setting the sticky bit prevents users from overwriting each other's files, whether
                accidentally or maliciously, and is generally appropriate for most world-writable directories. However, consult appropriate
                vendor documentation before blindly applying the sticky bit to any world writable directories found in order to avoid

        <xhtml:br/> Sometimes when administrators delete users from the password file they

        <xhtml:code>/etc/ftpusers</xhtml:code> contains a list of users who are not allowed to access the system via FTP. Consider

                account under which your Web server process runs.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Generally, only normal users should ever access the system via FTP - there should be no reason for "system" type
                accounts to transfer information via this mechanism. If a system userid is allowed to FTP files into the system, that userid
                can be used to upload malicious software and store it with the system userid's permissions (which are probably higher than a
                normal user's). Certainly, the root account should never be allowed to transfer files directly via FTP. (Of course, there is
                probably no reason for FTP to be enabled at all - this is mostly "defense in depth" in case FTP accidentally becomes
                re-enabled, or if it's required for some function that is unable to use SSH instead).<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> The above script places all users those user id is less than 200 in the <xhtml:code>/etc/ftpusers</xhtml:code>

        <xhtml:br/> X servers listen on port <xhtml:code>6000/tcp</xhtml:code> for messages
                from remote clients running on other systems. However, X Windows uses a relatively insecure authentication protocol - an
                attacker who is able to gain unauthorized access to the local X server can easily compromise the system. Invoking the
                    <xhtml:code>"-nolisten tcp"</xhtml:code> option causes the X server not to listen on port
                <xhtml:code>6000/tcp</xhtml:code> by default.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> This does prevent authorized remote X clients from displaying windows on the local system as well. However, the
                forwarding of X events via SSH will still happen normally. This is the preferred and more secure method transmitting results
                from remote X clients in any event. <xhtml:br/></xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:br/> Anonymous root logins should never be allowed, except on the system
                console in emergency situations. At all other times, the administrator should access the system via an unprivileged account
                and use some authorized mechanism (such as the su command, or the freely-available sudo package) to gain additional
                privilege. These mechanisms provide at least some limited audit trail in the event of problems. The command above
                additionally restricts 'su' to root to members of the 'system' group, making it harder for an attacker to use a stolen root
                password (as they will first have to get access to a 'system' userid).<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note: Ensure you have at least one user account in the system group that can log in remotely. Failure to do so
                will prevent any remote user from becoming root. </xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:br/> An account with an empty password field means that anybody may log in as

                it changes the default profile, which applies to all newly created users. <xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> With a default umask setting of 077 - a setting agreed to as part of the consensus process with DISA and NSA -
                files and directories created by users will not be readable by any other user on the system. The user creating the file has
                the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the <xhtml:code>chmod</xhtml:code> command.
                Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default umask
                by inserting the <xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code> command into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.)
                in their home directories. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a
                umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> Note: This is been shown to cause problems with the installation of software packages where the installation
                script uses the default umask - the directories are owned by root with 700 permissions, and then the application and/or
                daemon cannot read its files. A simple fix to this problem is to manually issue a less restrictive
                <xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code> (such as umask 022) for the shell session doing the installation, or place such a
                    <xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code> command (in the beginning of the installation script) to a less restrictive value before
                the installation, or in the beginning of the installation script. </xccdf:description>

            are other mechanisms available for acquiring this information). Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require
            that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to
            monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such
            monitoring. Clearly, the organization's local legal counsel and/or site security administrator should review the content of all
            messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site-specific.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/> More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at
