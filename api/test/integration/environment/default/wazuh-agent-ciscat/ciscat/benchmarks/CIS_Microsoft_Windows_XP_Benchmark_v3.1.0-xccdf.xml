   <notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS")
      provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other
      services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to
      Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result
      from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally
      generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to
      organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and
      devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to
      specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick
      fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
      CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or
      negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any
      particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of
      any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the
      Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is"
      and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER
      AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We")
      agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component
      can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our
      own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of
      the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure
      to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the
      Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our
      particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below)
      has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify
      us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS
      nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract,
      tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or
      special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or
      damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of
      privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted
      management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties)
      arising out of or in any way Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the
      Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages),
      including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual
      property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other
      harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but
      only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1.
      Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written
      agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single
      computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a
      Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are
      printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed
      Terms of Use in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON
      DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and
      by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any
      intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to
      the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights
      not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
      Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some
      classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have
      otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile,
      disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software
      Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute,
      encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any
      Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on
      any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device,
      without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or
      alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in
      any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter
      these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi)
      use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a
      Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product
      with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such
      Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a
      particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will
      not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed
      in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers,
      directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates,
      licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all
      other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or
      Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses,
      costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS
      Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding
      paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive
      defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree
      to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are
      third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS
      has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other
      persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special
      rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are
      covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software
      Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains
      in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the
      right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization,
      whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and
      may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION;
      VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and
      construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in
      equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the
      courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal
      jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these
      Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable,
      then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability
      of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE
      AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN
      ALL RESPECTS.</notice>

                        will have the right to attach a debugger to any process or to the kernel,
                        which provides complete access to sensitive and critical operating system
                        components. Developers who are debugging their own applications do not need

                        system components will need it. Note Microsoft released several security
                        updates in October 2003 that used a version of Update.exe that required the
                        administrator to have the Debug programs user right. Administrators who did
                        not have this user right were unable to install these security updates until
                        they reconfigured their user rights. This is not typical behavior for
                        operating system updates. For more information, see Knowledge Base article
                        830846: Windows Product Updates may stop responding or may use most or all

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">The Debug programs user right can be exploited to

                        to insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is
                        assigned only to administrators, which helps to mitigate the risk from this
                        vulnerability. The value of removing this user right from members of the
                        Administrators group is diminished by the fact that a malicious user who has
                        administrative privileges can bypass the countermeasure by launching

                              if you have installed optional components such as ASP.NET or IIS, you
                              may need to assign the Adjust memory quotas for a process user right
                              to additional accounts that are required by those components. IIS
                              requires that this privilege be explicitly assigned to the
                              IWAM_&lt;ComputerName&gt;, Network Service, and Service accounts.
                              Otherwise, this countermeasure should have no impact on most
                              computers. If this user right is necessary for a user account, it can

                        access domain resources after they are logged on. Also, problems will occur
                        when Group Policy is applied to client computers if the system time is not
                        synchronized with the domain controllers.</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">Users who can change the time on a computer could
                        cause several problems. For example, time stamps on event log entries could
                        be made inaccurate, time stamps on files and folders that are created or
                        modified could be incorrect, and computers that belong to a domain may not
                        be able to authenticate themselves or users who try to log on to the domain
                        from them. Also, because the Kerberos authentication protocol requires that
                        the requestor and authenticator have their clocks synchronized within an
                        administrator-defined skew period, an attacker who changes a computer's time
                        may cause that computer to be unable to obtain or grant Kerberos tickets.
                        The risk from these types of events is mitigated on most domain controllers,
                        member servers, and end-user computers because the Windows Time service
                        automatically synchronizes time with domain controllers in the following
                        ways: . All client desktop computers and member servers use the
                        authenticating domain controller as their inbound time partner. . All domain
                        controllers in a domain nominate the primary domain controller (PDC)
                        emulator operations master as their inbound time partner. . All PDC emulator
                        operations masters follow the hierarchy of domains in the selection of their
                        inbound time partner. . The PDC emulator operations master at the root of
                        the domain is authoritative for the organization. Therefore it is
                        recommended that you configure this computer to synchronize with a reliable
                        external time server. This vulnerability becomes much more serious if an
                        attacker is able to change the system time and then stop the Windows Time
                        service or reconfigure it to synchronize with a time server that is not
                        accurate.</rationale>

                        there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID
                        rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename
                        the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by
                        using the SID to log on.</rationale>

                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then forward themso that the server might
                        perform undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                              where it is supported. The secure channel protects domain credentials
                              as they are sent to the domain controller. However, only Windows NT
                              4.0 with Service Pack 6a (SP6a) and subsequent versions of the Windows
                              operating system support digital encryption and signing of the secure
                              channel. Windows 98 Second Edition clients do not support it unless
                              they have the Dsclient installed. Therefore, you cannot enable the

                              members of the domain. Potential impacts can include the following: .
                              The ability to create or delete trust relationships with clients
                              running versions of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will
                              be disabled. . Logons from clients running versions of Windows earlier
                              than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a will be disabled. . The ability to
                              authenticate other domains' users from a domain controller running a
                              version of Windows earlier than Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a in a trusted
                              domain will be disabled. You can enable this policy setting after you
                              eliminate all Windows 9x clients from the domain and upgrade all
                              Windows NT 4.0 servers and domain controllers from trusted/trusting
                              domains to Windows NT 4.0 with SP6a. You can enable the other two

                              that do not support these algorithms will not be able to use servers
                              that require them for network communications. For example, many
                              Apache-based Web servers are not configured to support TLS. If you
                              enable this setting, you also need to configure Internet Explorer to
                              use TLS. This policy setting also affects the encryption level that is
                              used for the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). The Remote Desktop
                              Connection tool uses the RDP protocol to communicate with servers that
                              run Terminal Services and client computers that are configured for
                              remote control; RDP connections will fail if both computers are not
                              configured to use the same encryption algorithms. To enable Internet
                              Explore to use TLS 1. On the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click
                              Internet Options. 2. Click the Advanced tab. 3. Select the Use TLS 1.0
                              check box. It is also possible to configure this policy setting
                              through Group Policy or by using the Internet Explorer Administrators
                              Kit. Client computers running Windows XP, Windows XP SP1 and Windows
                              XP SP2 that try to connect to a Terminal Services server that has this
                              setting enabled will be unable to communicate with the server until an
                              updated version of the Terminal Services client is installed. This
                              issue could aslo affect Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop
                              connections. For more information about the issue and how to resolve

                        on a single network. Network capabilities include transparent file and print
                        sharing, user security features, and network administration tools. In Active
                        Directory domains, the Kerberos protocol is the default authentication
                        protocol. However, if the Kerberos protocol is not negotiated for some
                        reason, Active Directory will use LM, NTLM, or NTLMv2. LAN Manager
                        authentication includes the LM, NTLM, and NTLM version 2 (NTLMv2) variants,
                        and is the protocol that is used to authenticate all Windows clients when
                        they perform the following operations: . Join a domain . Authenticate
                        between Active Directory forests . Authenticate to down-level domains .
                        Authenticate to computers that do not run Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003,
                        or Windows XP) . Authenticate to computers that are not in the domain The
                        possible values for the Network security: LAN Manager authentication level
                        setting are: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses . Send LM &amp; NTLM — use
                        NTLMv2 session security if negotiated . Send NTLM responses only . Send
                        NTLMv2 responses only . Send NTLMv2 responses only\refuse LM . Send NTLMv2
                        responses only\refuse LM &amp; NTLM . Not Defined The Network security: LAN
                        Manager authentication level setting determines which challenge/response
                        authentication protocol is used for network logons. This choice affects the
                        authentication protocol level that clients use, the session security level
                        that the computers negotiate, and the authentication level that servers
                        accept as follows: . Send LM &amp; NTLM responses. Clients use LM and NTLM
                        authentication and never use NTLMv2 session security. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send LM &amp; NTLM use NTLMv2
                        session security if negotiated. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication and
                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send NTLM response only.
                        Clients use NTLM authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2
                        authentication only and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports
                        it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Send
                        NTLMv2 response only\refuse LM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only and
                        use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        refuse LM (accept only NTLM and NTLMv2 authentication). . Send NTLMv2
                        response only\refuse LM &amp; NTLM. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication only
                        and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain
                        controllers refuse LM and NTLM (accept only NTLMv2 authentication). These
                        settings correspond to the levels discussed in other Microsoft documents as
                        follows: . Level 0 Send LM and NTLM response; never use NTLMv2 session
                        security. Clients use LM and NTLM authentication, and never use NTLMv2
                        session security. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Level 1 Use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated. Clients
                        use LM and NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the
                        server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2
                        authentication. . Level 2 Send NTLM response only. Clients use only NTLM
                        authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it.
                        Domain controllers accept LM, NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 3
                        Send NTLMv2 response only. Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, and use NTLMv2
                        session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers accept LM,
                        NTLM, and NTLMv2 authentication. . Level 4 Domain controllers refuse LM
                        responses. Clients use NTLM authentication, and use NTLMv2 session security
                        if the server supports it. Domain controllers refuse LM authentication, that
                        is, they accept NTLM and NTLMv2. . Level 5 Domain controllers refuse LM and
                        NTLM responses (accept only NTLMv2). Clients use NTLMv2 authentication, use
                        and NTLMv2 session security if the server supports it. Domain controllers
                        refuse NTLM and LM authentication (they accept only NTLMv2).</description>
                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In Windows Vista, this setting is undefined. However,
                        in Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows XP clients are configured
                        by default to send LM and NTLM authentication responses (Windows 95-based
                        and Windows 98-based clients only send LM). The default setting on servers
                        allows all clients to authenticate with servers and use their resources.
                        However, this means that LM responses—the weakest form of authentication
                        response—are sent over the network, and it is potentially possible for
                        attackers to sniff that traffic to more easily reproduce the user's
                        password. The Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT operating systems
                        cannot use the Kerberos version 5 protocol for authentication. For this
                        reason, in a Windows Server 2003 domain, these computers authenticate by
                        default with both the LM and NTLM protocols for network authentication. You
                        can enforce a more secure authentication protocol for Windows 95, Windows
                        98, and Windows NT by using NTLMv2. For the logon process, NTLMv2 uses a
                        secure channel to protect the authentication process. Even if you use NTLMv2
                        for earlier clients and servers, Windows-based clients and servers that are
                        members of the domain will use the Kerberos authentication protocol to
                        authenticate with Windows Server 2003 domain controllers.</rationale>

                        digital signing in Windowsbased networks helps to prevent sessions from
                        being hijacked. If you enable this policy setting, the Microsoft network
                        client will use signing only if the server with which it communicates
                        accepts digitally signed communication. Microsoft recommends to enable The
                        Microsoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees)
                        setting. Note Enabling this policy setting on SMB clients on your network
                        makes them fully effective for packet signing with all clients and servers

                        have access to the same network as the client or server to interrupt, end,
                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform
                        undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or
                        client after legitimate authentication and gain unauthorized access to data.
                        SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows
                        operating systems. SMB signatures authenticate both users and the servers
                        that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data
                        transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows

                        For an LDAP server, this susceptibility means that an attacker could cause a

                        or steal a session in progress. Attackers can potentially intercept and
                        modify unsigned SMB packets and then them so that the server might perform
                        undesirable actions. Alternatively, the attacker could pose as the server or

                        SMB is the resource sharing protocol that is supported by many Windows

                        that host the data. If either side fails the authentication process, data
                        transmission will not take place.</rationale>

                           <p>The Windows 2000 and later implementations of the SMB file and print
                              sharing protocol support mutual authentication, which protect against
                              session hijacking attacks and support message authentication to
                              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SMB signing provides this
                              authentication by placing a digital signature into each SMB, which is
                              then verified by both the client and the server. Implementation of SMB
                              signing may negatively affect performance, because each packet needs
                              to be signed and verified. If these settings are enabled on a server
                              that is performing multiple roles, such as a small business server
                              that is serving as a domain controller, file server, print server, and
                              application server performance may be substantially slowed.
                              Additionally, if you configure computers to ignore all unsigned SMB
                              communications, older applications and operating systems will not be
                              able to connect. However, if you completely disable all SMB signing,
                              computers will be vulnerable to session hijacking attacks. When SMB
                              signing policies are enabled on domain controllers running Windows
                              Server 2003 and member computers running Windows Vista SP1 or Windows
                              Server 2008 group policy processing will fail. A hotfix is available
                              from Microsoft that resolves this issue; see Microsoft Knowledgebase

                        <p>When event logs fill to capacity, they will stop recording information
                           unless the retention method for each is set so that the computer will
                           overwrite the oldest entries with the most recent ones. To mitigate the
                           risk of loss of recent data, you can configure the retention method so
                           that older events are overwritten as needed. The consequence of this
                           configuration is that older events will be removed from the logs.
                           Attackers can take advantage of such a configuration, because they can
                           generate a large number of extraneous events to overwrite any evidence of
                           their attack. These risks can be somewhat reduced if you automate the
                           archival and backup of event log data. Ideally, all specifically
                           monitored events should be sent to a server that uses Microsoft
                           Operations Manager (MOM) or some other automated monitoring tool. Such a
                           configuration is particularly important because an attacker who
                           successfully compromises a server could clear the Security log. If all
                           events are sent to a monitoring server, then you will be able to gather
                           forensic information about the attacker's activities.</p>

                        ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When this
                        policy is enabled, passwords must meet the following minimum requirements: .
                        Not contain the user's account name or parts of the user's full name that
                        exceed two consecutive characters . Be at least six characters in length .
                        Contain characters from three of the following four categories: . English
                        uppercase characters (A through Z) . English lowercase characters (a through
                        z) . Base 10 digits (0 through 9) . Non-alphabetic characters (for example,
                        !, $, #, %) . A catch-all category of any Unicode character that does not
                        fall under the previous four categories. This fifth category can be
                        regionally specific. Each additional character in a password increases its
                        complexity exponentially. For instance, a seven-character, all lower-case
                        alphabetic password would have 267 (approximately 8 x 109 or 8 billion)
                        possible combinations. At 1,000,000 attempts per second (a capability of
                        many password-cracking utilities), it would only take 133 minutes to crack.
                        A seven-character alphabetic password with case sensitivity has 527
                        combinations. A seven-character case-sensitive alphanumeric password without
                        punctuation has 627 combinations. An eight-character password has 268 (or 2
                        x 1011) possible combinations. Although this might seem to be a large
                        number, at 1,000,000 attempts per second it would take only 59 hours to try
                        all possible passwords. Remember, these times will significantly increase
                        for passwords that use ALT characters and other special keyboard characters
                        such as ! or @. Proper use of the password settings can help make it
                        difficult to mount a brute force attack.</description>

                              characters. However, all users should be able to comply with the
                              complexity requirement with minimal difficulty. If your organization
                              has more stringent security requirements, you can create a custom
                              version of the Passfilt.dll file that allows the use of arbitrarily
                              complex password strength rules. For example, a custom password filter
                              might require the use of non-upper row characters. (Upper row
                              characters are those that require you to hold down the SHIFT key and
                              press any of the digits between 1 and 0.) A custom password filter
                              might also perform a dictionary check to verify that the proposed
                              password does not contain common dictionary words or fragments. Also,
                              the use of ALT key character combinations can greatly enhance the
                              complexity of a password. However, such stringent password
                              requirements can result in unhappy users and an extremely busy help
                              desk. Alternatively, your organization could consider a requirement
                              for all administrator passwords to use ALT characters in the 01280159
                              range. (ALT characters outside of this range can represent standard
                              alphanumeric characters that would not add additional complexity to
                              the password.)</p>

                           There are many different theories about how to determine the best
                           password length for an organization, but perhaps pass phrase is a better
                           term than password. In Microsoft Windows 2000 or later, pass phrases can
                           be quite long and can include spaces. Therefore, a phrase such as I want
                           to drink a $5 milkshake is a valid pass phrase; it is a considerably
                           stronger password than an 8 or 10 character string of random numbers and
                           letters, and yet is easier to remember. Users must be educated about the
                           proper selection and maintenance of passwords, especially with regard to
                           password length.<br/>In enterprise environments, ensure that the value
                           for the Minimum password length setting is configured to 8 characters.
                           This policy setting is long enough to provide adequate security. In high
                           security environments, configure the value to 12 characters.</p>

                                 phrases, which are often easier to remember and, due to the larger

                                 and Windows NT#x00AE; 4.0 do not support passwords that are longer
                                 than 14 characters. Computers that run these older operating

                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This policy setting determines the
                           number of failed logon attempts before a lock occurs. Authorized users
                           can lock themselves out of an account by mistyping their password or by
                           remembering it incorrectly, or by changing their password on one computer
                           while logged on to another computer. The computer with the incorrect
                           password will continuously try to authenticate the user, and because the
                           password it uses to authenticate is incorrect, a lock occurs. To avoid
                           accidental lockout of authorized users, set the account lockout threshold
                           to a high number. The default value for this policy setting is 0 invalid
                           logon attempts, which disables the account lockout feature.<br/>Because
                           it is possible for an attacker to use this lockout state as a denial of
                           service (DoS) by triggering a lockout on a large number of accounts, your
                           organization should determine whether to use this policy setting based on
                           identified threats and the risks you want to mitigate. There are two
                           options to consider for this policy setting.<br/>. Configure the value
                           for Account lockout threshold to 0 to ensure that accounts will not be
                           locked out. This setting value will prevent a DoS attack thattempts to
                           lock out accounts in your organization. It will also reduce help desk
                           calls, because users will not be able to lock themselves out of their
                           accounts accidentally. However, this setting value will not prevent a
                           brute force attack. The following defenses should also be
                           considered:<br/>. A password policy that forces all users to have complex
                           passwords made up of 8 or more characters.<br/>. A robust auditing
                           mechanism, which will alert administrators when a series of account
                           lockouts occurs in the environment. For example, the auditing solution
                           should monitor for security event 539, which is a logon failure. This
                           event identifies that there was a lock on the account at the time of the
                           logon attempt.<br/>The second option is:<br/>. Configure the value for
                           Account lockout threshold to a value that provides users with the ability
                           to mistype their password several times, but locks out the account if a
                           brute force password attack occurs. This configuration will prevent
                           accidental account lockouts and reduce help desk calls, but will not
                           prevent a DoS attack.</p>

                           methods to try millions of password combinations for any user account.
                           The effectiveness of such attacks can be almost eliminated if you limit
                           the number of failed logons that can be performed.<br/>However, a denial
                           of service (DoS) attack could be performed on a domain that has an
                           account lockout threshold configured. An attacker could programmatically
                           attempt a series of password attacks against all users in the
                           organization. If the number of attempts is greater than the account
                           lockout threshold, the attacker might be able to lock out every
                           account.</p>

                                 ICMP message types. As a result, utilities that rely on ICMP may
                                 fail. Some applications require some ICMP messages in order to

                                 performance when Group Policy is downloaded and processed; if ICMP
                                 messages are blocked, Group Policy may not be applied to affected
                                 systems. Note If any policy setting opens TCP port 445, Windows

                           administration exception setting is available. If you enable this
                           setting, computers in your environment should accept remote
                           administration requests from as few computers as possible. To maximize
                           the protection provided by Windows Firewall, make sure to specify only
                           the necessary IP addresses and subnets of computers that are used for
                           remote administration.</description>

                              <p>If you enable the Windows Firewall: Define inbound port exceptions

                                 defined by Group Policy. To view and modify the port exceptions
                                 list, configure the setting to Enabled and then click the Show
                                 button. Note that if you type an invalid definition string, Windows
                                 Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors, which
                                 means that you can accidentally create multiple entries for the
                                 same port with Scope or Status values that conflict. If you disable
                                 the Windows Firewall: Define inbound port exceptions setting, the
                                 port exceptions list that is defined by Group Policy is deleted but
                                 other settings can continue to open or block ports. Also, if a
                                 local port exceptions list exists, it is ignored unless you enable
                                 the Windows Firewall: Allow local port exceptions setting. Note If
                                 any policy setting opens TCP port 445, Windows Firewall allows
                                 inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those sent by the Ping

                                 policy setting would block them. Policy settings that can open TCP
                                 port 445 include Windows Firewall: Allow inbound file and printer

                           Control Message Protocol (ICMP) message types that Windows Firewall
                           allows. Utilities can use ICMP messages to determine the status of other
                           computers. For example, Ping uses the echo request message. If you
                           configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Enabled,
                           you must specify which ICMP message types Windows Firewall allows the
                           computer to send or receive. When you configure this policy setting to
                           Disabled, Windows Firewall blocks all unsolicited inbound ICMP message
                           types and the listed outbound ICMP message types. As a result, utilities
                           that rely on ICMP may fail. Many attacker tools take advantage of
                           computers that accept ICMP message types and use these messages to mount
                           a variety of attacks. However, some applications require some ICMP
                           messages in order to function properly. Also, ICMP messages are used to
                           estimate network performance when Group Policy is downloaded and
                           processed; if ICMP messages are blocked, Group Policy may not be applied
                           to affected systems. For that reason, it is recommended that you
                           configure the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting to Disabled
                           whenever possible. If your environment requires some ICMP messages to get
                           through Windows Firewall, configure this policy setting with the
                           appropriate message types. Whenever the computer is on an untrusted
                           network, the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP exceptions setting should be
                           configured to Disabled. Note If any policy setting opens TCP port 445,
                           Windows Firewall allows inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those
                           sent by the Ping utility), even if the Windows Firewall: Allow ICMP
                           exceptions policy setting would block them. Policy settings that can open
                           TCP port 445 include Windows Firewall: Allow inbound file and printer
                           sharing exception, Windows Firewall: Allow inbound remote administration
                           exception, and Windows Firewall: Define inbound port

                                 Firewall adds it to the list without checking for errors, which
                                 means that you can accidentally create multiple entries for the
                                 same port with Scope or Status values that conflict. If you disable
                                 the Windows Firewall: Define inbound port exceptions setting, the
                                 port exceptions list that is defined by Group Policy is deleted but
                                 other settings can continue to open or block ports. Also, if a
                                 local port exceptions list exists, it is ignored unless you enable
                                 the Windows Firewall: Allow local port exceptions setting. Note If
                                 any policy setting opens TCP port 445, Windows Firewall allows
                                 inbound ICMP echo request messages (such as those sent by the Ping

                           invitations. Depending on your e-mail program, you can use either the
                           Mailto standard (the invitation recipient connects through an Internet
                           link) or the SMAPI (Simple MAPI) standard (the invitation is attached to

                     server to host updates from the Microsoft Update Web site. You can then use
                     this update service location to automatically update computers on your network.
                     The Automatic Updates client will search this service for updates that apply to
                     the computers on your network. To use the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, you must set two server name values: the server from
                     which the Automatic Updates client detects and downloads updates, and the
                     server to which updated workstations upload statistics. You can set both values
                     to be the same server. If you enable the Specify intranet Microsoft update
                     service location setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect to the
                     specified intranet Microsoft update service server (instead of Windows Update)
                     to search for and download updates. This configuration allows end users in your
                     organization to avoid firewall issues, and provides you with an opportunity to
                     test updates before you deploy them. If you disable or do not configure this
                     policy setting, the Automatic Updates client will connect directly to the
                     Windows Update site on the Internet (if Automatic Updates is not disabled by

                     <rationale xml:lang="en">In its default configuration, the Windows Corporate
                        Error Reporting features of Windows XP and Office will send data to
                        Microsoft that some organizations may prefer to keep confidential. The
                        Microsoft privacy statement for Windows Corporate Error Reporting ensures
                        that Microsoft will not misuse data that is collected through Windows
                        Corporate Error Reporting. However, some organizations may want to configure
                        this feature so that no information is transmitted outside of the
                        organization without first being reviewed by a trusted member of the IT
                        team. Conversely, if error reporting is disabled completely, it is more
                        difficult for Microsoft to identify and diagnose new bugs. Organizations
                        that develop their own internal business applications can also take
                        advantage of Windows Corporate Error Reporting to track down problems within
                        their code. A reasonable configuration that ensures privacy and uses Windows
                        Corporate Error Reporting effectively is to set up your own internal
                        Corporate Error Reporting (CER) servers. Configure your client computers to
                        point to these servers when they have error reports to submit. An
                        administrator can then review the reports on the CER server and generate an
                        aggregate report for Microsoft that contains no confidential
                        information.</rationale>

                     Typically, users can either click the Unblock button in the file's Property

                     information is removed, users can open potentially dangerous file attachments

                  <description xml:lang="en">This policy setting allows you to manage whether
                     Windows marks file attachments from Internet Explorer or Microsoft Outlook®
                     Express with information about their zone of origin (such as restricted,
                     Internet, intranet, or local). This policy setting requires that files be
                     downloaded to NTFS disk partitions to function correctly. If zone information
                     is not preserved, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments based on the zone
                     where the attachment came from. If the Do not preserve zone information in file
                     attachments setting is enabled, file attachments are not marked with their zone
                     information. If this policy setting is disabled, Windows is forced to store
                     file attachments with their zone information. Because dangerous attachments are
                     often downloaded from untrusted Internet Explorer zones such as the Internet
                     zone, it is recommended that you configure this policy setting to Disabled to
                     help ensure that as much security information as possible is preserved with
                     each file.</description>
