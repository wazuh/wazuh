  <xccdf:title>CIS SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.0 SP1 Benchmark</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:description>This benchmark was developed and tested on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 10 SP1. It is likely to work for other versions of SUSE Linux as well (such as openSUSE). The scoring tool may yield inaccurate results on non-SUSE systems.</xccdf:description>
  <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">
  BACKGROUND.
  
  The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.  Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.  The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.  Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.  The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
  
  NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
  
  CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of  the Products or the Recommendations.  CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.  
  
  USER AGREEMENTS.

      <p style="margin-top: 0.17in; page-break-after: avoid">CIS SuSE Linux Enterprise Server Benchmark </p>
      <h3>Applicability</h3>
      <p>This benchmark was developed and tested on SuSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 9.0. It is likely to work for
        other versions of SuSE Linux as well (such as SuSE Linux Professional). The scoring tool may yield inaccurate
        results on non-SuSE systems. </p>
      <h3>Conventions</h3>
      <p>The following typographical conventions are used in this document:</p>
      <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="530">

          </td>
          <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">
            <p>used for a question that you must evaluate before continuing</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3 style="background: #c0c0c0">Root Shell Environment Assumed </h3>
      <p>The actions listed in this document are written with the assumption that they will be executed by the root user
        running the bash shell and without noclobber set. Also, the following directories are assumed to be in root's
        path: <br/> /bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin </p>
      <h3>Executing Actions </h3>
      <p>The actions listed in this document are written with the assumption that they will be executed in the order
        presented here. Some actions may need to be modified if the order is changed. Actions are written so that they
        may be copied directly from this document into a root shell window with a "cut-and-paste" operation. You may
        find that many of the "chkconfig" actions, which activate or deactivate services, produce the message
        "&lt;service name&gt;: unknown service" These messages are quite normal and should not cause alarm –
        they simply indicate that the program being referenced was not installed on your machine. As SuSE Linux installs
        allow a great deal of flexibility in what software you choose to install, these messages are unavoidable. </p>
      <h3>Reboot Required </h3>
      <p>Rebooting the system is required after completing all of the actions below in order to complete the
        re-configuration of the system. In many cases, the changes made in the steps below will not take effect until
        this reboot is performed. If substantial operating system updates are performed after the initial OS load, you
        may have to reboot more than once. </p>
      <h3>Vulnerabilities</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">In addition to any specific issues presented by a particular service or protocol, <b><i>every </i></b>service has the potential of being an entry point into a system if a vulnerability is found. This is why we
        recommend that some services are disabled even though there is no clear way to exploit them, and there has never
        been a problem with the service. If you are running an un-needed service, you could have a problem if a hole is
        found. </p>
      <h3>Backup Key Files </h3>
      <p>Before performing the steps of this benchmark it is strongly recommended that administrators make backup copies
        of critical configuration files that may get modified by various benchmark items. If this step is not performed,
        then the site may have no reasonable back-out strategy for reversing system modifications made as a result of
        this document. The script provided in Appendix B of this document will automatically back up all files that may
        be modified by the actions below. Note that an executable copy of this script is also provided in the archive
        containing the PDF version of this document and the CIS scoring tool. Assuming the administrator is in the
        directory where the archive has been unpacked, the command to execute the backup script would be: </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">
        <b>./do-backup.sh</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the byproducts of the do-backup.sh script is /root/do-restore.sh, which is dynamically generated based
        on the results of the do-backup.sh script. To roll back the changes performed by this benchmark, first run
          <b>RevertBastille</b> followed by <b>do-restore.sh</b>, and all changes will be backed out. Since not all
        Linux installations are identical, the do-restore.sh script is created based on the files that actually existed
        at the time do-backup.sh was run. </p>
      <p>Note: If you make any changes manually to any of the files that were preserved by do-backup.sh, those changes
        will be lost when do-restore.sh is executed. It may be prudent to delete the do-restore.sh script once you have
        validated the changes to prevent inadvertently undoing the changes. </p>
      <h3>Build Considerations </h3>
      <p>If you have not done so already, plan out a partitioned hard drive. The default partitioning for Suse Linux
        Enterprise Server is similar to this: </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">/ 1 GB</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">swap 1xRAM</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">/var 1 GB</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">/usr 4 GB</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">/opt 4 GB</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">/home remaining disk space</p>
      <p>
        <br/>It is important to keep /var and /home on their own partitions. Some applications have a tendency to crash
        when the / or /usr filesystem reaches 100%. This could happen if users were to store considerable amounts of
        data (developers storing jar files or copies of application logs, for example) or logs were to fill up their
        partition. Some Enterprises define a /logs partition and store application logs there. </p>
      <p>For additional security, an additional and separate partition may be created for /boot which creates the kernel
        binaries and boot loader configuration. A /boot partition may be mounted read-only to avoid accidental damage
        and to make malicious changes a little bit more difficult (e.g. less space for backdoors in malicious kernel
        patches). A read-only /boot partition however will require special procedures for a valid kernel patch (or
        update). </p>
      <p>To limit the inconveniences caused by filling up /home, consider implementing user and group quotas on the
        /home filesystem. Quotas will limit how much a single user (or single group) can store on a given filesystem.
        More information is available in the Suse Linux manuals (see the installation CDs). </p>
      <h3>Software Package Removal</h3>
      <p>There is considerable debate over the maintenance of unused software packages. Some people feel that as long as
        the software is not being used, leaving it installed poses no appreciable risk. Others feel that unused software
        presents another attack vector and increases the maintenance effort for the administrators. This Benchmark makes
        no recommendation for the removal of unused software. If vulnerable software is present on a system, that
        vulnerability may be exploitable by a local attacker, and the reader is advised to consider the effort in either
        its removal or maintenance and the risks thereof. </p>
      <h3>Software Package Installation</h3>
      <p>Throughout this Benchmark, you may be directed to enable software package init scripts using the chkconfig
        command. This assumes you already installed said package(s). If the chkconfig command fails, verify you actually
        installed the software required. </p>
      <h3>
        <xccdf:sub idref="Bastille"/>Notes About Bastille </h3>
      <p>Throughout this Benchmark, you will see the Bastille castle in the left margin. This indicates a section that
        is addressed by Bastille. If you installed Bastille and ran it with the configuration file provided, this area
        will already be taken care of for you. </p>
      <p>It is still worth walking through that section to ensure your system is configured properly. In some cases
        where the logo appears, that section is addressed by Bastille, but it is the script provided does not address it
        as manual intervention is required. Setting a LILO/GRUB password is an example of this case. Bastille addresses
        setting the password, however, that must be set per system. In those cases, a note will appear in <b><i>bold italics</i></b> regarding Bastille. </p>

      <h1>Appendix A Additional Security Notes</h1>
      <p>The items in this section are security configuration settings that have been suggested by several other
        resources and system hardening tools. However, given the other settings in the benchmark document, the settings
        presented here provide relatively little incremental security benefit. Nevertheless, none of these settings
        should have a significant impact on the functionality of the system, and some sites may feel that the slight
        security enhancement of these settings outweighs the (sometimes minimal) administrative cost of performing them. </p>
      <p>None of these settings will be checked by the automated scoring tool provided with the benchmark document. They
        are purely optional and may be applied or not at the discretion of local site administrators. </p>
      <h2>SN.1 Create Symlinks For Dangerous Files </h2>
      <h3>Action: </h3>
      <p>for FILE in /root/.rhosts /root/.shosts /etc/hosts.equiv \<br/> /etc/shosts.equiv; do<br/> rm -f $FILE<br/> ln
        -s /dev/null $FILE<br/>done </p>
      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p>The /root/.rhosts, /root/.shosts, and /etc/hosts.equiv files enable a weak form of access control (see the
        discussion of .rhosts files above). Attackers will often target these files as part of their exploit scripts. By
        linking these files to /dev/null, any data that an attacker writes to these files is simply discarded (though an
        astute attacker can still remove the link prior to writing their malicious data). </p>
      <h2>SN.2 Change Default Greeting String For sendmail</h2>
      <h2 style="font-weight: medium">Not applicable to SuSE as SuSE does not ship with sendmail.</h2>
      <p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </p>
      <h2>SN.3 Enable TCP SYN Cookie Protection</h2>
      <h3>Action:</h3>
      <p>echo "echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_syncookies" \<br/>&gt;&gt; /etc/init.d/boot.local </p>
      <h3>Discussion:</h3>
      <p>A "SYN Attack" is a denial of service (DoS) attack that consumes resources on your system forcing you to
        reboot. This particular attack is performed by beginning the TCP connection handshake (sending the SYN packet),
        and then never completing the process to open the connection. This leaves your system with several (hundreds or
        thousands) of half-open connections. This is a fairly simple attack and should be blocked. </p>
      <h2>
        <!-- Redundant – already handled by changes to kernel settings. -->SN.4 Additional LILO/GRUB Security </h2>
      <h3>Action:</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">chattr +i /etc/lilo.conf </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">chattr +i /boot/grub/menu.lst </p>
      <h3>Discussion:</h3>
      <p>Setting the immutable flag on the LILO and GRUB config files will prevent any changes (accidental or otherwise)
        to the lilo.conf or menu.lst files. If you wish to modify either file you will need to unset the immutable flag
        using the chattr command with -i instead of +i. </p>
      <h2>SN.5 Evaluate Packages Associated With Startup Scripts</h2>
      <h3>Question: </h3>
      <p>How many of the startup script do you really need? </p>
      <p>Perform the action below. </p>
      <h3>Action: </h3>
      <p>cd /etc/init.d<br/>ls </p>
      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p>The most effective way to get rid of the much of the unused software is to look in the startup directory
        /etc/init.d and evaluate which of these remaining services are not necessary. Use rpm -qf
        &lt;scriptname&gt; to determine the package it belongs to, use rpm -qi &lt;packagename&gt; to
        read about it, then use rpm -e &lt;packagename&gt; to remove it. For example, this server may not use
        Broadcom NIC drivers, and therefore will not need the bcm5820 package. rpm -qf bcm5820 shows us bcm5820 belongs
        to bcm5820-1.17-6. rpm -qi bcm5820 proves we do not need this package. rpm -e bcm5820 takes care of it. </p>
      <p>In some cases, you will not be able to remove a script/package – kdcrotate is a good example: it belongs to
        package krb5-libs, which is required by several packages, including sendmail and nss_ldap. In cases like this,
        you may just want to use chkconfig &lt;sccriptname&gt; off to keep it from running. </p>
      <p>You should consider configuring iptables to act as a server-level firewall. There is controversy over this
        technique as some organizations feel all they need is the perimeter firewall and others feel the perimeter is
        just the first line of defense. </p>
      <h2>SN.6 Evaluate Every Installed Package</h2>
      <h3>Question: </h3>
      <p>How much unused software was installed on your system? </p>
      <p>Perform the action below. </p>
      <h3>Action: </h3>
      <p>See Discussion</p>
      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p>SuSE Linux installation includes many packages that are usually not necessary in an Enterprise server
        environment (dosfstools, for example). Computer Security Industry Best Practices recommend removing unused
        services and software to minimize attack vectors on a system. The following references suggest removing unused
        software: </p>

      <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">rpm -qa | sort | less </p>
      <p>in one shell, and then using the other shell to remove the packages. You will find some packages are dependent
        upon others and you will have to remove several packages at once. In some cases, an unused package will be
        required by another useful package, and it will have to remain installed – for example, dateconfig may rely upon
        audiofile. If the features of dateconfig are required, then audiofile will have to remain. One may think that
        the functionality of dateconfig is not necessary, however, this tool is used to adjust the date, timezone and
        NTP settings of the server, and some Enterprises will have problems making system changes to servers without
        using the vendor-recommended tools. </p>
      <p>Also note that if the service is disabled, the relevant software should be removed for the following reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Less software to maintain and monitor for security issues.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The service cannot be inadvertently enabled by an errant administrator.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Minimize damage in an attack should the attacker gain (or already have) access to the server.</p>
        </li>

      <p>Removed software can always be reinstalled using the Enterprise procedures.</p>
      <p>By using this methodology on a test server, a still functional basic server was produced with less than 230
        packages installed (down from the original 350 packages) taking up under 350MB of disk storage. This was
        performed in under an hour.. </p>
      <h2>SN.7 Install and Configure sudo</h2>
      <h3>Action: </h3>
      <p>Using your Enterprise process, install sudo.</p>
      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p>sudo is a package that allows the System Administrator to delegate activities to groups of users. These
        activities are normally beyond the administrative capability of that user – restarting the web server, for
        example. If frequent web server configuration changes are taking place (or you have a bug and the web server
        keeps crashing), it becomes very cumbersome to continually engage the SysAdmin just to restart the web server.
        sudo allows the Administrator to delegate just that one task using root authority without allowing that group of
        users any other root capability. </p>
      <p>Once sudo is installed, configure it using visudo – do not vi the config file. visudo has error checking built
        in. Experience has shown that if /etc/sudoers gets botched (from using vi without visudo's error checking
        feature), recovery may become very difficult. </p>
      <h2>SN.8 Additional Kernel Tunings</h2>
      <h3>Action: </h3>
      <p>cat &lt;&lt;END_SCRIPT &gt;&gt; /etc/sysctl.conf<br/># Following 2 lines added by CISecurity
        Benchmark sec SN.9<br/>net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans = 256<br/>net.ipv4.conf.all.log_martians =

        "/etc/sysctl.conf \troot.root\t600\n" &gt;&gt; \<br/> /etc/permissions.local<br/><br/><br/></p>
      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p>Before implementing these changes, please review them with your environment in mind. The above value for
        tcp_max_orphans is much lower than the default 16,384, and may be too low, depending on the server's use and
        environment. </p>
      <p>Also be aware that logging all martians may generate an excessive amount of logs, especially on multi-homed
        servers with at least one network interface on a hostile network (i.e, your border firewalls). You should ensure
        you have plenty of log space available as well as sending your logs to a remote logging host. </p>

      <h3>Discussion: </h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.1in">C compilers pose a credible threat to production systems and should not be
        installed. Compilers should be installed on select development systems – those systems that have a Business need
        for a compiler – and the resulting output binaries deployed onto other development and production systems using
        the existing Enterprise change processes. </p>

      <h1>Appendix C Bastille Configuration</h1>
      <p>Here is the recommended Bastille configuration.</p>
      <p>Note: Bastille has the ability to set the GRUB/LILO boot passwords but it is not used here to ensure the
        password is unique to the Enterprise implementing this Benchmark. Setting this password is covered in section
        7.8 of the Benchmark. </p>
      <p>Points to note where the CISecurity Benchmark differ from Bastille'e defaults:</p>
      <p>Q: What umask would you like to set for users on the system? <b>027</b></p>
      <p>See the umask discussion in sections 3.1 and 8.10. Do not just blindly change the umask without fully
        understanding the ramifications of doing so. Read the umask discussion in sections 3.1 and 8.10. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable the gcc compiler? <b>Yes</b></p>
      <p>Removing compilers unless absolutely necessary is a long-standing industry best practice.</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to run sendmail via cron to process the queue? <b>Yes</b></p>
      <p>Allowing sendmail to process the mail queue is a good idea as important alerts may have been generated and will
        be sitting in the queue, waiting to be processed. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to deactivate the Apache web server? Yes</p>
      <p>Note: All answers regarding Apache configuration are non-intrusive answers as configuring Apache is outside of
        the scope of a Level 1 Operating System Benchmark. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to bind the web server to listen only to the localhost? No</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to bind the web server to a particular interface? No</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to deactivate the following of symbolic links? <b>No</b></p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to deactivate server-side includes? <b>No</b></p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable CGI scripts, at least for now? <b>No</b></p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable indexes? No</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable printing? <b>Yes</b></p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable printing? <b>Yes</b></p>
      <p>Note: This question is asked twice to account for both types of printing systems – BSD lpr and cups. Most
        servers will not need to print. If they do need to print, the printing functionality will be restored in section
        3.14. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable user privileges on the FTP daemon? No</p>
      <p>Note: All answers regarding FTP configuration are non-intrusive answers as configuring the FTP daemon is
        outside of the scope of a Level 1 Operating System Benchmark. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to disable anonymous download? No</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to install TMPDIR/TMP scripts? No</p>
      <p>Q: Would you like to run the packet filtering script? No</p>
      <p>Note that use of host-based firewalls may interfere with existing Enterprise practices and the Level 1
        benchmark makes no recommendation for enabling or disabling the host-based packet filter. </p>

      <xhtml:p>Updating the operating system by applying software patches is the first step for 
        ensuring the security and reliability of the system.  Vendors issue operating system 
        updates when they become aware of security vulnerabilities and other serious 
        functionality issues, but it is up to their customers to actually download and install these 
        patches.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:title>Apply Latest OS Patches </xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>Update system per your Enterprise Update procedures.</p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Developing a procedure for keeping up-to-date with vendor patches is critical for the security and
          reliability of the system. Vendors issue operating system updates when they become aware of security
          vulnerabilities and other serious functionality issues, but it is up to their customers to actually download
          and install these patches. </p>
        <p>When Novell publishes an update for SuSE Linux, they include the procedures with it for updating the package.
          This usually entails downloading the new RPMs from Novell, and making them available to the individual
          servers. Some Enterprises make these packages available over an NFS share or an internal anonymous FTP/HTTP
          server – your Enterprise may follow this practice or do something different. </p>
        <p>It is also important to observe that your applications work properly after patching. Though problems in
          patches are quite rare in SuSE Linux, it is generally recommended that any patch be deployed to a
          non-production system first for testing. </p>
        <p>Some RPMs may need to be installed before others. For the most part, RPM understands and solves dependencies.
          Novell creates separate instructions for special cases, like the replacement of the kernel or the general C
          library glibc. You may need to examine the list of updates that you have downloaded to check for any of these
          cases. </p>
        <p>Finally, there is some risk to using a non-patched, non-hardened machine to download the patches, as this
          involves connecting a system with security vulnerabilities on a network, which is not an Industry Best
          Practice. Please consider these issues carefully. One approach is to use a stateful hardware firewall to
          separate and protect the unpatched system from all other systems. For the purpose of update and installation
          the hardware firewall should be configured to prevent all inbound connections; as well as packets that aren’t
          part of an established session. </p>
        <p>Novell offers at least partially automated patch download and installation via YaST Online Update. In lieu of
          an existing Enterprise Standard, consider using YaST Online Update whenever Novell announces vulnerabilities.
          If your Enterprise has several servers, consider installing an update server that can be used in place of the
          update servers at Novell– the updates will go much faster, you will use much less bandwidth from your ISP, and
          you will reduce the load on Novell's servers. </p>
        <p>If YaST Online Update is used, it should be used on a lab server and the patches validated and the system
          regression tested before going to live/production systems. </p>

      <xccdf:description>
        <p>Ensuring your system is functioning properly before you make a change is a prudent system administration best
          practice and will save you hours of aggravation. Applying this Benchmark to a system that already has issues
          makes troubleshooting very difficult and may lead you to believe the Benchmark is at fault. </p>
        <p>Examine the system and application logs (/var/log). Key words to look for include, but are not limited to,
          "error", "warning", "critical", and "alert". </p>
        <p>Performing a scan for rootkits is a prudent measure. Some enterprises may also wish to perform further
          validation on the integrity of the operating system: anti-virus scanning and checking the integrity of system
          files against a trusted database of file hashes. While this standard does not endorse specific tools, the
          following are examples of tools used. </p>
        <p>Rootkit detection: Chkrootkit, Rootkit Hunter or kstat (for advanced users).</p>
        <p>Anti-virus: clamav (freeware) or commercial anti-virus products from Computer Associates, F-Secure,
          Kaspersky, Sophos, Symantec or Trend Micro. </p>
        <p>Trusted hash databases: The NSRL hash database, a database of file hashes from this server, stored on a
          separate system (e.g. hashes from AIDE, Tripwire, Trusted Computing Base, etc). </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>OpenSSH is a popular free distribution of the standards-track SSH protocols which has become the standard
          implementation on Linux distributions. For more information on OpenSSH, see <a href="http://www.openssh.org/" shape="rect">http://www.openssh.org</a>. </p>
        <p>The settings in this section attempt to ensure safe defaults for both the client and the server.
          Specifically, both the ssh client and the sshd server are configured to use only SSH protocol 2, as security
          vulnerabilities have been found in the first SSH protocol. This may cause compatibility issues at sites still
          using the vulnerable SSH protocol 1 these sites should endeavor to configure all systems to use only SSH
          protocol 2. </p>
        <p>Note that a banner is added in the sshd_config file – we will create this banner later and it is discussed in
          detail in section 9. If you choose not to implement a banner, you will have to remove the reference to
          /etc/issue from sshd_config manually. Please read the section on the legal use of banners before deciding to
          remove it. </p>

        <p>System accounting gathers baseline system data (CPU utilization, disk I/O, etc.) every 10 minutes. The data

          normal baseline for the system has been established, unauthorized activity (password crackers and other
          CPU-intensive jobs, and activity outside of normal usage hours) may be detected due to departures from the
          normal system performance curve. Note that this data is only archived for one week before being automatically
          removed by the regular nightly cron job. Administrators may wish to archive the /var/log/sa/ directory on a
          regular basis to preserve this data for longer periods. </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is there a reason to allow unlimited network access to this server? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is no, then perform the action below.</p>
        <h3>Action:</h3>
        <p>
          <i>
            <b>Note: Bastille configuration set to 'No'</b>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>Note:</i>
          </b> Do not deny access to your system without allowing access. Complete both parts of this section. </p>
        <p>TCP Wrappers</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Deny access to this server from all networks:</p>

          /etc/hosts.deny </p>
        <p>To allow access from the authorized networks, refer to the hosts.allow man page and enter the service and the
          network in /etc/hosts.allow. At a minimum, you need to allow localhost traffic. The following script will
          create a sample hosts.allow file that will allow access to the locally connected networks: </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.49in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"> printf "ALL: localhost" &gt; /etc/hosts.allow<br/>for

          <b>
            <i>Note:</i>
          </b> The above script intentionally ignores IPv6 networks. </p>
        <p>You should review the resulting /etc/hosts.allow to ensure it meets your needs. Test your configuration now
          by logging in remotely. </p>
        <p>You may wish to further customize your configuration. For example, if you would like to ensure that only one
          ip address, 192.168.50.4, can access SSH on your server at 192.168.50.2, then follow the example below. </p>
        <p>Change /etc/hosts.allow from:</p>
        <p> ALL: localhost, 192.168.50.2/255.255.255.0</p>
        <p>to:</p>
        <p> sshd : 192.168.50.4/255.255.255.255 : ALLOW</p>
        <p> ALL EXCEPT sshd: localhost, 192.168.50.2/255.255.255.0</p>

        <p>See discussion.</p>
        <h3>Discussion:</h3>
        <p>TCP Wrappers and Host-Based Firewalls are presented together as they are similar and complementary in
          functionality.</p>
        <p>TCP Wrappers</p>
        <p>By limiting access to the server, you reduce your exposure to threats from attackers on remote systems. For
          Internet-connected servers that provide service to the whole Internet, limiting access may not make sense.
          Intranet servers, limited-access servers, and workstations should limit access to only authorized networks. </p>
        <p>Many daemons (SSH for example) are compiled with TCP Wrapper support, so you can use /etc/hosts.allow and
          /etc/hosts.deny to limit SSH access to your systems. The portmap daemon also uses TCP wrappers and there is a
          specific note to this effect in the default TCP wrappers config files. </p>
        <p>It is important to note that TCP wrappers looks at hosts.allow first, then hosts.deny, and controls access
          based on the first match. If you omit entries in hosts.allow and deny access to ALL in hosts.deny, you will
          block network access to all network clients. </p>
        <p>Host-Based Firewalls</p>
        <p>Host-based firewalls (also known as personal firewalls) have the following benefits:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">Protection from compromised systems on the local network;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">Defense in depth where an attacker must overcome both the border firewall and the
          host-based firewall to attack a system; </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">Extremely fine tuned control over what systems may or may not access the system.</p>
        <p>The Center for Internet Security recommends installing a host-based firewall on workstations, and suggests
          end-users consider installing them on servers as well. </p>
        <p>Workstations are defined as Linux systems that offer no services to any external network or system. For
          example, a workstation that is running Apache and serving up content to the local network segment is not a
          workstation. </p>
        <p>Host-based firewalls are available in iptables (installed by default) or via commercial offerings. The Center
          for Internet Security makes no recommendations for a vendor or even a specific firewall configuration as
          firewalls are very complex systems. Entire books have been written on iptables and are outside the scope of
          this benchmark. There are options during installation that allow you to minimally configure the iptables
          firewall (to be confirmed and examined in greater detail). There are also sample files. </p>
        <p>The default configuration of iptables should not be considered secure without specific configuration. The
          Center for Internet Security recommends using a tool (graphical- or text-based) to configure the firewall as
          manual rule configuration is extremely error-prone and you may end up with a false sense of security and have
          a less secure system. </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is there a mission-critical reason that requires users to access this system via telnet, rather than the more
          secure SSH protocol? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig telnet on </p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>telnet uses an unencrypted network protocol, which means data from the login session (such as passwords and
          all other data transmitted during the session) can be stolen by eavesdroppers on the network, and also that
          the session can be hijacked by outsiders to gain access to the remote system. The freely-available SSH
          utilities that ship with SuSE Linux (see <a href="http://www.openssh.com/" shape="rect">http://www.openssh.com/</a>) provide encrypted network logins and should be used instead. </p>
        <p>To aid in the migration to SSH, there is a freely available SSH client for Windows called putty, which is
          available from Simon Tatham (see <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/" shape="rect">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</a>). There are numerous commercially supported SSH
          clients as well – check to see if your Enterprise already has an Enterprise SSH client. </p>
        <p>Some Enterprises are using telnet over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard solution is to use SSH.
          Configuring telnet over SSL is beyond the scope of a Level 1 Benchmark and will not be addressed here. </p>
        <p>It is understood that large Enterprises deeply entrenched in using telnet may take considerable effort in
          migrating from telnet to ssh, so telnet may have to be enabled. When it can be disabled, simply run chkconfig
          telnet off to turn it off again. </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is this machine an (anonymous) FTP server, or is there a mission-critical reason why data must be transferred
          to and from this system via an ftp server, rather than sftp or scp? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig vsftpd on </p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means passwords and other data transmitted during the
          session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the FTP session itself can be hijacked by an
          external attacker. SSH provides two different encrypted file transfer mechanisms – scp and sftp – and should
          be used instead. Even if FTP is required because the local system is an anonymous FTP server, consider
          requiring non-anonymous users on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. For further information
          on restricting FTP access to the system, see section 7.2 below. </p>
        <p>Note: Any directory writable by an anonymous FTP server should have its own partition. This helps prevent an
          FTP server from filling a hard drive used by other services. </p>
        <p>To aid in the migration away from FTP, there are a number of freely available scp and sftp client for
          Windows, such as WinSCP (available from <a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php" shape="rect">http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php</a>) for a Graphical interface to putty, and pscp, which is a
          part of the previously mentioned putty package. </p>
        <p>Some Enterprises are using FTP over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard solution is to use SSH.
          Configuring FTP over SSL is beyond the scope of a Level 1 Benchmark and will not be addressed here. </p>

        <p>The r-commands suffer from the same hijacking and sniffing issues as telnet and ftp, and in addition have a

          for these protocols. Given the wide availability of free SSH implementations, it seems unlikely that there is
          ever a case where these tools cannot be replaced with SSH (again, see <a href="http://www.openssh.com/" shape="rect">http://www.openssh.com/</a>). </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is this system a boot server or is there some other mission-critical reason why data must be transferred to
          and from this system via TFTP? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig tftp on <br/>if [ ! -d "/tftpboot" ] ; then <br/> mkdir -m 0755 /tftpboot &amp;&amp; \<br/>
          chown root:root /tftpboot <br/>fi </p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>TFTP is typically used for network booting of diskless workstations, X-terminals, and other similar devices.
          Routers and other network devices may copy configuration data to remote systems via TFTP for backup. However,
          unless this system is needed in one of these roles, it is best to leave the TFTP service disabled. </p>
        <p>Note: The tftp-server software is not installed by default on SuSE Linux. You will have to install it if you
          need to use it. After installing it, perform the actions above. </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is this system a mail server – that is, does this machine receive and process email from other hosts? Note:
          The email server need not be running to send outgoing mail. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <h3 style="font-weight: medium">if [ -f "/etc/postfix/master.cf" ]; then<br/> cd /etc/posfix<br/> awk '$1 ~

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>It is possible to run a Unix system with the postfix daemon disabled and still allow users on that system to
          send email out from that machine. Running postfix in "<i>daemon mode</i>" is only required on machines that
          act as mail servers, receiving and processing email from other hosts on the network. Note that if the system
          is an email server, the administrator is encouraged to search the Web for additional documentation on postfix
          security issues. </p>
        <p>Experienced administrators will understand that a chroot-jailed user or program can still interact with a
          postfix process listening on the <i>loopback</i> interface. </p>

      <xccdf:description>
        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is there a mission-critical reason to run a GUI login program on this system? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is no, proceed with the actions below. </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>This action disables the graphical login, if present, leaving the user to login via SSH or a normal
          text-based console. If you elect to deactivate the GUI login screen, users can still run X Windows by typing
          startx at the shell prompt. In SuSE Linux, there are two main runlevels that the system runs in. Runlevel 5
          boots directly into X Windows, so as to allow graphical login or easy use of specialized X terminals.
          Otherwise, for normal text-based console login, runlevel 3 is desirable. GUI login is activated or deactivated
          by changing this runlevel in /etc/inittab. Again, note that runlevel 3 still allows the user to run X Windows
          by typing startx at the shell prompt. </p>

        <p>Every system daemon that does not have a clear and necessary purpose on the host should be deactivated. This
          greatly reduces the chances that the machine will be running a vulnerable daemon when the next vulnerability
          is discovered in its operating system. </p>
        <p>SuSE Linux uses a facility called chkconfig to manage all the SysV rc-scripts. chkconfig adds or deletes
          links in each of the appropriate runlevel directories (/etc/rc.d/rc*.d) to activate or deactivate each of the
          rc-scripts. </p>
        <p>This process "chkconfig's" all of the rc-scripts off, so that the local administrator can easily reactivate
          any of these scripts upon discovery of a mission-critical need for one of these services. One could reactivate
          the daemon script by typing chkconfig daemon on in most cases, which activates it in runlevels 2 through 5. If
          one of these runlevels is undesirable, like runlevel 2 for the NFS script, or the script needs to run in one
          of the other available runlevels, chkconfig takes the argument " level &lt;levels&gt;" where one can
          explicitly specify runlevels that it should act on. </p>
        <p>Note that vendor patches may restore some of the original entries in the startup script directories
          /etc/rc.d/rc*.d – it is always a good idea to check these boot directories and remove any scripts that may
          have been added by the patch installation process. This would be a good time to ensure this check is in your
          Enterprise OS Upgrade Procedure. </p>
        <p>The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services –
          in particular, the services that are disabled in the second loop in the "Action" section above. Rather than
          disabling and then re-enabling these services, experienced administrators may wish to simply disable only
          those services that they know are unnecessary for their systems. </p>
        <p>The third loop in the "Action" section locks daemon-user accounts related to servers that we examine by
          setting a lockout password. This will not prevent a given daemon from running as these users – it simply
          confirms that these users are not available for human login. It also changes the shell to /bin/false for an
          additional layer of security as long as shell access is not necessary. Bear in mind that some packages
          (findutils up to version 4.1.20, for example) do not work properly without a shell for the nobody account – be
          sure you test this thoroughly if you choose to invalidate the daemon shells. </p>
        <p>Note: Not all of the scripts listed above will exist on all systems, as this is a superset of the available
          rc-scripts in the various SuSE distributions. The benchmark's recommended action will register some trivial
          errors on each distribution version as a result – these are not cause for alarm. </p>

        <p>SuSE Linux includes the popular Open Source Samba server for providing file and print services to
          Windows-based systems. This allows a Unix system to act as a file or print server in on a Windows network, and
          even act as a Domain Controller (authentication server) to older Windows operating systems. However, if this
          functionality is not required by the site, the service should be disabled. </p>

        <p>NFS is frequently exploited to gain unauthorized access to files and systems. Clearly there is no need to run
          the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. If the system is an NFS server, the
          administrator should take reasonable precautions when exporting file systems, including restricting NFS access
          to a specific range of local IP addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" where appropriate. For more
          information, consult the exports manual page. </p>

        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Is this machine a DNS server, or name server, for this site? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig named on</p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Most of the machines in the organization do not need a DNS server running on the box. Unless this is one of
          the organization's name servers, it is safe to shut this down. </p>
        <p>If this must be left active, please patch often and consider tightening the configuration. One highly
          suggested configuration is to bind the DNS server program in a chroot environment. This significantly
          restricts the resources that the DNS server has access to on the system, reducing this set to the minimum
          required for the program to function properly. The BIND name server that most machines run has had major
          security problems recently. </p>
        <p>Additionally, consider the use of Access Control Lists (ACL's) in /etc/named.conf to limit who can query your
          name server. For example, Internal name servers should not respond to outside requests. Large Enterprises run
          multiple name servers so this should not be an issue. However, smaller organizations may not be able to deploy
          internal and external name servers and should consider this precaution. </p>

      <xccdf:title>Only Enable Squid Cache Server If Absolutely Necessary </xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Do you use the squid web cache to speed up web transactions? </p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, proceed with the actions below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig squid on</p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Squid can actually be beneficial to security, as it imposes a proxy between the client and server. On the
          other hand, if it is not being used, it should be deactivated and removed. This deactivation decreases the
          risk of system compromise should a security vulnerability later be discovered in Squid. Finally, if your site
          does used Squid, do configure it carefully. Many Squid caches are badly configured to either allow outsider
          attackers to probe internal machines through the firewall or to use the cache to hide their true source IP
          address from their target hosts. Each site should configure Squid to not allow people outside their perimeter
          to use the cache without authentication of some sort. A better deployment for squid is on a server with no
          external-facing network interface (unless you are using it for a reverse web proxy, which is a very specific
          installation, and beyond the scope of this benchmark). </p>

      <xccdf:title>Only Enable hwscan Hardware Detection If Absolutely Necessary </xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <h3>Question: </h3>
        <p>Does the site absolutely need to allow users at the console to add hardware to the system?</p>
        <p>If the answer to this question is yes, then perform the action below. </p>
        <h3>Action: </h3>
        <p>chkconfig hwscan on</p>
        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Hwscan is SuSE Linux's hardware detection program, which is normally set to run during system startup. It
          detects changes in hardware and, without demanding authentication of any sort, allows the user at the console
          to configure that hardware. This lack of authentication presents the primary danger – any user sitting at the
          console during a reboot can configure any new devices added to the system. </p>
        <p>This configuration is an unnecessary risk for most sites, with the exception of those that need to allow
          users to easily make hardware changes without having a root password. Sites in the exception class might need
          to allow students to connect external hard drives, backup drives or other potentially common external devices. </p>
        <p>If you deactivate this rc-script, hwscan is still accessible. To run hwscan after installing new hardware,
          run /etc/init.d/hwscan start at the shell prompt while logged in as root. </p>

          reliable enough to prevent datagram loss.</p>

        <p>Placing "nodev" on these partitions prevents users from mounting unauthorized devices on any partitions that
          we know should not contain devices. There should be little need to mount devices on any partitions other than
          /dev. </p>
        <p>One notable exception, of course, is the case where system programs are being placed into "chroot jails"-
          these often require that several devices be created in the chroot directory. If you are using chroot jails on

        <p>In SLES, only the root user can mount removable media such as a floppy or cdrom for use, by default. However

        <p>When the so-called "sticky bit" is set on a directory, then only the owner of a file may remove that file
          from the directory (as opposed to the usual behavior where anybody with write access to that directory may
          remove the file). Setting the sticky bit prevents users from overwriting each other's files, whether
          accidentally or maliciously, and is generally appropriate for most world-writable directories. However,
          consult appropriate vendor documentation before blindly applying the sticky bit to any world writable
          directories found in order to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given directory. </p>

        <p>Do not allow any unowned files on your system. Unowned files may be an indication an intruder has accessed
          your system or improper package maintenance/installation. Sometimes a package removal results in unowned files
          or directories related to this software as the user/group associated with that package is removed, but that
          user's files (i.e., files changed after the package was installed) are left behind. Another common cause is
          the installation of software that does not properly set file ownerships. </p>
        <p>Files in any NFS mounts may be ignored as the user ID mapping between systems may be out of sync. If your
          Enterprise uses a central user management system (NIS or LDAP), the presence of unowned files may indicate

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>Used in conjunction with the BSD-style "r-commands" (rlogin, rsh, rcp), the <br/>.rhosts files implement a
          weak form of authentication based on the network address or host name of the remote computer (which can be
          spoofed by a potential attacker to exploit the local system). Disabling .rhosts support helps prevent users
          from subverting the system's normal access control mechanisms. </p>
        <p>If .rhosts support is required for some reason, some basic precautions should be taken when creating and
          managing .rhosts files. Never use the "+" wildcard character in <br/>.rhosts files. In fact, .rhosts entries
          should always specify a specific trusted host name along with the user name of the trusted account on that
          system (e.g., "trustedhost alice" and not just "trustedhost"). Avoid establishing trust relationships with
          systems outside of the organization's security perimeter and/or systems not controlled by the local
          administrative staff. Firewalls and other network security elements should actually block rlogin/rsh/rcp
          access from external hosts. </p>
        <p>Finally, make sure that .rhosts files are only readable by the owner of the file (i.e., these files should be
          mode 600). </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>X servers listen on port 6000/tcp for messages from remote clients running on other systems. However, X
          Windows uses a relatively insecure authentication protocol and an attacker who is able to gain unauthorized
          access to the local X server can easily compromise the system. Invoking the "-nolisten tcp" option causes the
          X server not to listen on port 6000/tcp by default. This prevents authorized remote X clients from displaying
          windows on the local system as well. However, the forwarding of X events via SSH will still happen normally.
          This is the preferred and more secure method transmitting results from remote X clients in any event. </p>

        <p>would restrict connections to only the 192.168.1.0/24 network, with the netmask 255.255.255.0. </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>This item configures xinetd to use simple IP-based access control and log connections. Just as xinetd's
          access control mechanisms are used to monitor illicit connection attempts, the popular PortSentry tool (<a href="http://www.psionic.com/products/portsentry.html" shape="rect">http://www.psionic.com/products/portsentry.html</a>) can be used to monitor access attempts on unused
          ports. Note that running PortSentry may result in the CIS testing tools reporting "false positives" for
          "active" ports that are actually being held by the PortSentry daemon. Consider replacing the PortSentry daemon
          with PSAD, short for Port Scan Attack Detector, available from <a href="http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/" shape="rect">http://www.cipherdyne.com/psad/</a>. Unlike PortSentry, PSAD doesn't have to hold open ports --
          instead, it communicates directly with the kernel. </p>

        <p>Anonymous root logins should never be allowed, except on the system console in emergency situations. At all
          other times, the administrator should access the system via an unprivileged account and use some authorized
          mechanism (such as the su command, or the freely-available sudo package) to gain additional privileges. These
          mechanisms provide at least some audit trail in the event of problems. </p>
        <p>Many Enterprises – who use serial port concentrators to connect to a server in a data center without
          physically having to use the keyboard – consider the serial port a console. This is in keeping with the Unix
          server tradition of controlling headless Unix machines using a serial port console. Just like the virtual
          consoles, this one needs protected as well. If this applies to your organization, you may execute these lines: </p>
        <p>echo ttyS0 &gt;&gt; /etc/securetty <br/>echo ttyS1 &gt;&gt; /etc/securetty </p>
        <p>Be advised that doing so will reduce your CIS Scoring Tool score and reduce your security posture.</p>

        <p>By default on most Linux systems, the boot loader prompt allows an attacker to subvert the normal boot
          process very easily. The action above will allow the system to boot normally, only requiring a password when
          the user attempts to modify the boot process by passing commands to LILO or GRUB. Make sure to replace
          &lt;password&gt; in the actions above with a good password. </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>On some Linux systems you can enter single user mode simply by typing "linux single" at the LILO prompt or in
          the GRUB boot-editing menu. This represents a clear security risk – authentication should always be required
          for root-level access. It should be noted that it is extremely difficult to prevent compromise by any attacker
          who has knowledge, tools, and full physical access to a system. This kind of measure simply increases the
          difficulty of compromise by requiring more of each of these factors. </p>
        <p>SuSE Linux prevents this risk, by default, however this item checks for the proper setting and puts it back
          in place if it is missing. </p>
        <p>The last two items have attempted to address concerns of physical/boot security. To make these preparations
          more complete, one should consider setting the BIOS to boot only from the main hard disk and locking this
          setting with a BIOS password. For more information on reducing the threat posed by an attacker with
          physical/boot access, consider the article "Anyone with a Screwdriver Can Break In," available at <a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html" shape="rect">http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html</a>. </p>
        <p>Note: Even though this topic is addressed by Bastille, it performs a step not executed by Bastille and should
          be completed even if Bastille was used. </p>

      <xccdf:description>
        <p>By default the system logging daemon, syslogd, does not listen for log messages from other systems on network
          port 514/udp (Solaris, by contrast, does listen by default). </p>
        <p>It is considered good practice to set up one or more machines as central "log servers" to aggregate log
          traffic from all machines at a site. However, unless a system is set up to be one of these "log server"
          systems, it should not be listening on 514/udp for incoming log messages as the protocol used to transfer
          these messages does not include any form of authentication, so a malicious outsider could simply barrage the
          local system's Syslog port with spurious traffic either as a denial-of- service attack on the system, or to
          fill up the local system's logging file systems so that subsequent attacks will not be logged. </p>

        <p>These accounts are non-human system accounts that should be made less useful to an attacker by locking them
          and setting the shell to a shell not in /etc/shells. They can even be deleted if the machine does not use the
          daemon/service that each is responsible for, though it is safest to simply deactivate them as is done here. To
          deactivate them, lock the password and set the login shell to an invalid shell. /bin/false is a good choice—it
          is a valid executable that is not a valid login shell. /bin/false is the choice used by Novell for SuSE Linux
          instead of /dev/null or /bin/nologin. </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>It is a good idea to force users to change passwords on a regular basis. The commands above will set all
          active accounts (except system accounts) to force password changes every 90 days (-M 90), and then prevent
          password changes for seven days (-m 7) thereafter. Users will begin receiving warnings 28 days (-W 28) before
          their password expires. Once the password expired, the account will be locked out after 7 days (-I 7).
          Finally, the instructions above set a minimum password length of 6 characters. </p>
        <p>These are recommended starting values. Some regulated industries require more restrictive values – ensure
          they comply with your Enterprise security policy. </p>

        <h3>Discussion: </h3>
        <p>With a default umask setting of 077 – a setting agreed to as part of the consensus process with DISA and NSA
          – files and directories created by users will not be readable by any other user on the system. The user
          creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod
          command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a
          different default umask by inserting the umask command into the standard shell configuration files (.profile,
          .cshrc, etc.) in their home directories. A umask of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in
          the same Unix group, while a umask of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system. </p>
        <p>We adjust root's umask setting separately in this item, as root shells don't necessarily read the system-wide
          configuration files. For example, root sessions using bash doesn't get umask settings from /etc/profile. </p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0.08in">Note: This is been shown to cause problems with the installation of software
          packages where the installation script uses the default umask – the directories are owned by root with 700
          permissions, and then the application and/or daemon cannot read its files. A simple fix to this problem is to
          manually issue a less restrictive umask (such as umask 022) for the shell session doing the installation, or
          place such a umask command in the beginning to a less restrictive value before the installation, or in the
          beginning of the installation script. </p>

        <p>The su command allows you to become other users on the system. This is commonly used to become “root” and
          execute commands as the super-user. If you do not want certain users to su to root then ensure the following
          line exists in /etc/pam.d/su: </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 0.49in">auth required pam_wheel.so</p>
        <p>This line allows only the users in the wheel group to become root by using the su command and entering the
          root password. All other users will receive a message stating the password is incorrect. </p>
        <p>By limiting access to the root account, even if a user knows the root password, they will not be able to
          become root unless that user has physical access to the server's console, or they are added to the wheel
          group. This adds another layer of security to the system and prevents unauthorized system access. </p>

        <p>Whenever you make substantial changes to a system, reboot. Some System Administrators believe any change to
          the init scripts warrant a reboot to ensure the system comes up as expected. Hours of lost productivity with
          extensive troubleshooting (not to mention lost revenue) have occurred because a system did not start up as
          expected. The root cause was an init problem that would have been detected had the reboot taken place. </p>

    <xccdf:title>Warning Banners</xccdf:title>
    <xccdf:description> Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of
      trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version
      information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific attacks at a system. Guidelines
      published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns
      the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and
      that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. Clearly, the organization’s local legal counsel and/or site security
      administrator should review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are
      inherently site- specific. More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at

        <p>The contents of the /etc/issue file are displayed prior to the login prompt on the system's console and
          serial devices. /etc/motd is generally displayed after all successful logins, no matter where the user is
          logging in from, but is thought to be less useful because it only provides notification to the user after the
          machine has been accessed. </p>
