   <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
      <xhtml:p>This benchmark was created using a consensus review process comprised of volunteer and contract subject matter experts. Consensus participants provide perspective from a diverse set of backgrounds including consulting, software development, audit and compliance, security research, operations, government, and legal.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p> </xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>Each CIS benchmark undergoes two phases of consensus review. The first phase occurs during initial benchmark development. During this phase, subject matter experts convene to discuss, create, and test working drafts of the benchmark. This discussion occurs until consensus has been reached on benchmark recommendations. The second phase begins after the benchmark has been released to the public Internet. During this phase, all feedback provided by the Internet community is reviewed by the consensus team for incorporation in to the CIS benchmark. If you are interested in participating in the consensus review process, please send us a note to <xhtml:a href="mailto:feedback@cisecurity.org">feedback@cisecurity.org</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>

   <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en"> BACKGROUND. The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs. NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS. CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i)
      the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. USER AGREEMENTS. By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that: 1. No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure; 2. We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk; 3. We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 4. We have the sole responsibility to
      evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements; 5. Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and 6. Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way
      Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items. GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS. CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use: 1. Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and use each of the Products on a single computer; 2. Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use
      in its entirety. RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION. The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties. We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties. CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights." Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute,
      redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their
      functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product. We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph. We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter
      subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim. We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. SPECIAL RULES. CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship. Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules. CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means. Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the
      foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time. CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE. We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO
      BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.</xccdf:notice>

         <xhtml:p>This bechmark provides security configuration guidance for use during the configuration of the AIX 7.1 Operating System. The scope of the guide is applicable to AIX 7.1 TL-0 SP1 and above. The recommendations in this guide have been explicitly tested on AIX 7.1 TL-0 SP1 and AIX 7.1 TL-01.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>The suggested approach in terms of implementing this guide would be to install a vanilla AIX image, via NIM or the AIX product DVD's, followed by the recommendations detailed in this guide and any other corporate standardization i.e. software installation, filesystem and user creation. Once completed, a mksysb backup of the system could then be taken and this image could be deployed via NIM for any subsequent operating system builds. This would provide a standard build mechanism, ensuring 100% compliance to all company standards and the best practice recommendations detailed in this benchmark.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Within the AIX Base Operating System Installation Menus it is recommended that the following options are selected:</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>JFS2 filesystems</xhtml:li>
               <xhtml:li>Enable System Backups to install any system = yes *</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>* This is to ensure that all device drivers are installed into the operating system image for deploying to different server hardware configurations.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Also consider selecting the following option (dependant on environmental requirements as this may be too restrictive):</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:ul>
               <xhtml:li>Secure By Default = yes *</xhtml:li>
            </xhtml:ul>
            <xhtml:p>* This option performs a minimal software installation, and removes all clear password access such as <xhtml:span class="inline_block">telnet</xhtml:span> and <xhtml:span class="inline_block">rlogin</xhtml:span>. Secure by Default (SbD) also applies the <xhtml:span class="ph">AIX Security Expert</xhtml:span> high-security settings. Once installed the expansion pack cd is prompted for as SSH and SSL are installed for secure remote system accessibility. If the SbD installation option is selected through NIM, the system administrator should ensure that the relevant NIM <xhtml:span class="inline_block">lpp_source</xhtml:span> has the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">openssh </xhtml:span>and <xhtml:span class="inline_block">openssl </xhtml:span>images in place.</xhtml:p>

         <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
            <xhtml:p>Before entering into the recommendation section of this paper it is important to put into context the relevance of an AIX software maintenance strategy. It is imperative that regular Technology Level (TL) and Service Pack (SP) updates are regularly applied, to ensure that all known security vulnerabilities are addressed and to remain within a supported TL stream.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>The current IBM software maintenance strategy revolves around the release of Technology Levels and Service Packs. Technology Levels are released twice per year, one in the spring and the other in fall. They introduce support for new hardware, new functionality, and new features and contain cumulative fixes since the release of the previous TL. The fix support window for a given TL is two years from its release date.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>Service Packs are released throughout the lifecycle of the TL and address security vulnerabilities and other critical fixes. They are typically released every 12 weeks; obviously this timeframe is dependant on the number and criticality of the issues found.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>It is recommended that full TL's or SP's are applied rather than individual fixes, due to the far more rigorous certification and testing process. The large and complex matrix of possible fix combinations are not subjected to the same degree of testing and therefore installing individual fixes is not recommended.</xhtml:p>
            <xhtml:p>A security fix will be initially released as an interim fix, which is installed and maintained via the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">emgr </xhtml:span>framework. It is recommended that, unless it is an extremely critical security issue, to wait and apply the fix as part of a full SP release to ensure maximum system stability.</xhtml:p>

            <xccdf:description xml:lang="en">
               <xhtml:p>The recommended maintenance strategy is as follows:-</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:ul>
                  <xhtml:li>Stay current and refresh the TL of each system at least once a year - For maximum system stability wait until SP3 is released on the newer TL and then migrate</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Review the Service Packs for any security or critical fixes - apply these regularly throughout the life cycle of a TL</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>Do not apply interim fixes or individual fixes unless there is an urgent requirement to do so. Instead apply full TL's and SP's for maximum stability</xhtml:li>
                  <xhtml:li>There should be a monthly review of the security advisory bulletins to remain apprised of all known security issues. These can currently be viewed at the following URL:</xhtml:li>

               <xhtml:p>Within modern IT infrastructure, internal firewalls are typically implemented to separate the internal network from any corporate or internet environments and external firewalls to further protect these environments from the outside world. These firewall devices are typically only configured to allow access to the systems on the required core application or database ports. Therefore, port shunning and scan protection are typically something implemented by a firewall, rather than at the operating system level.</xhtml:p>

A customized XML file provides the ultimate flexibility in terms of being able to choose whether or not to implement every recommended AIX Security Expert controlled setting in this benchmark e.g. whether clear text password protocols are allowed. This policy can be easily modified depending on the environmental requirements. A simple edit of the customized XML file, prior to it being implemented, is all that is required. This flexibility is not present within the default Low, Medium and High Level policies which provide a pre-defined rigid level of security hardening standards.</xhtml:p>

                  <xhtml:br/>Prior to implementing the AIX Security Expert customized settings, please review the benchmark recommendations in the next section. If there are any settings that need to be changed from a recommended value, based on environmental requirements, edit the XML file using the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">vi</xhtml:span> command.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:br/>As much of the guide as possible has been automated within the AIX Security Expert customized XML file. This includes a number of recommendations normally outside the remit of the tool. In these instances the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">execmds </xhtml:span>functionality has been used to execute the appropriate commands and implement the recommendations.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>Once the recommendations have been reviewed, implementation of the customized XML file should be performed in the following way:</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:code class="pre_0.7357238037646447">

               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:br/>Once the XML has been successfully implemented, the applied settings are placed in the following file:</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>A development in AIX 6.1 was the ability to use different password algorithms as defined in <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/security/pwdalg.cfg</xhtml:span>. The traditional UNIX password algorithm is <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span>, which is a one-way hash function supporting only 8 character passwords. The use of brute force password guessing attacks means that <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span> no longer provides an appropriate level of security and so other encryption mechanisms are recommended.</xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:p>The recommendation of this benchmark is to set the password algorithm to <xhtml:span class="inline_block">ssha256</xhtml:span>. This algorithm supports long passwords, up to 255 characters in length and allows passphrases including the use of the extended ASCII table and the space character. Any passwords already set using <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crypt</xhtml:span> will remain supported, but there can only one system password algorithm active at any one time.</xhtml:p>

In the previous section, recommendations were made to disable the remote services in <xhtml:span class="inline_block">/etc/inetd.conf</xhtml:span>. This stops the server from accepting connections, but the binaries to initiate remote connections from the server to another host should also be restricted along with the daemons themselves being fully disabled. There are also many known security vulnerabilities that relate to these services, they are a primary target for any DoS attack.<xhtml:br/>It is recommended that, unless otherwise required, that the following services and daemons will have their execute permissions removed:<xhtml:br/>

                  <xhtml:span>information, in particular that generated by the auth facility, is logged remotely. This recommendation assumes that a remote and secure syslog server is available on the network. If this is not the case, please skip to the next recommendation.</xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:p>
                  <xhtml:span>The primary reason for logging remotely is to provide an un-editable audit trail of system access. If a hacker were to access a system and gain super user authority it would be easy to edit local files and remove all traces of access, providing the system administrator with no way of identifying the individual or group responsible. If the log data is sent remotely at the point of access, these remote logs can then be reconciled with local data to identify tampered and altered files. The logs can also be used as evidence in any subsequent prosecution.</xhtml:span>

From that research, new Counter mode algorithms (as described in RFC4344) were designed that are not vulnerable to these types of attacks and these algorithms are now recommended for standard use.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:p>Each NFS export on the server should have the <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-2</xhtml:span> option set. Without this, an NFS export could be at risk, where the remote root user effectively has root access on the NFS mount. By setting the export option <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-2</xhtml:span> , when the client attempts to access (read, write, or delete) the NFS mount, the server substitutes the UID to the server's nobody account, which is -2. This means that the root user on the client cannot access or change files that only root on the server can access or change. It is therefore recommended that root_squash is set on all exported filesystems. <xhtml:br/>The default value of any exported filesystem or directory is -2, another value has to be explicitly set.<xhtml:br/>As a more secure option you can set the option to <xhtml:span class="inline_block">anon=-1</xhtml:span>, which disables anonymous access. By default, secure NFS accepts
                  non-secure requests as anonymous.<xhtml:br/>NOTE: The root user on the client can still use <xhtml:span class="inline_block">su </xhtml:span>to become any other user and access and change that users files, assuming that the same user exists on the NFS server and owns files and/or directories in the NFS export.</xhtml:p>

               <xhtml:span>Network Information Service (NIS) or Yellow Pages (YP), is a client/server directory service </xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:span>protocol used for distributing system configuration data, such as: users, groups, passwords and hosts between computers in a network. This is typically done in larger environments to centralize the management of this data. </xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:span>If the NIS software is installed but not configured, an attacker can cripple a machine by starting NIS. In environments where NIS is utilized, tools like </xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:span>ypsnarf</xhtml:span>
               <xhtml:span>allow an attacker to grab the contents of your NIS maps, providing large amounts of information about your site.</xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:span>The first recommendation in this section is to de-install NIS, if it is installed, to lockdown this service. However, if NIS is used in the environment it is recommended that NIS+ is used instead. NIS+ is structured differently from NIS and supports secure and encrypted RPC, which resolves many of the security issues.</xhtml:span>

                     <xhtml:span>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a commonly used service that provides network management and monitoring capabilities. SNMP offers the capability to poll networked devices and monitor data such as utilization and errors from various subsystems on the host. SNMP is also capable of changing the configurations on the host, allowing remote management of the system. The protocol uses a community string for authentication from the SNMP client to the SNMP agent on the managed device.</xhtml:span>

                  <xhtml:span>System accounting gathers periodic baseline system data, such as CPU utilization and disk I/O. Once a normal baseline for the system has been established, unauthorized activities, such as a password cracking being executed and activity outside of normal usage hours may be detected due to departure from the normal system performance baseline. It is recommended that the </xhtml:span>
                  <xhtml:span>collection script is run on an hourly basis, every day, to help to detect any anomalies. It is also important to generate and review the system activity report on a daily basis. </xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:span>One of the primary causes of system outages is inadvertent or accidental command usage when a user has root privileges. Many users seemingly forget that they are logged in as root, or use inappropriate command arguments. The carte blanche use of the root account should be limited to those individuals who administer the operating system. Users such as database administrators, application support teams and troubleshooters can be given privileged access to the commands they need via tools such as sudo or enhanced RBAC. These tools require careful planning and implementation, but ultimately can eradicate the need for the root password. </xhtml:span>

               <xhtml:span>This is a further development of the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) packaged with previous versions of AIX. Unlike TCB, Trusted Execution is not an install time only option and it can be enabled on previously installed systems. Its primary purpose is to protect from Trojan horse style attacks, by only allowing the execution of certain executables and kernel extensions. </xhtml:span>

            <xhtml:p>
               <xhtml:span>TE has two modes of operation, online and offline. The online mode provides the most comprehensive security, as a check is made every time a file is loaded into memory. If the integrity checks fail, the file will not be loaded into memory. The offline mode checks file integrity at a specified time, via either the command line or via <xhtml:span class="inline_block">crontab</xhtml:span>. </xhtml:span>

This ensures that the programs executed are those which are intended to be and not malicious code masquerading as a true program.</xhtml:span>
