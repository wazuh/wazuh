        <xhtml:p>TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Background.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere (“Products”) as a public service to Internet users worldwide. Recommendations contained in the Products (“Recommendations”) result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature. The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices. Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements. The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a “quick fix” for anyone’s information security needs.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>No Representations, Warranties, or Covenants.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of the Products or the Recommendations. CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations “as is” and “as available” without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind. </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>User Agreements.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization (“We”) agree and acknowledge that:</xhtml:p>

            <xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:p>We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from CIS’s negligence or failure to perform;</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:p>We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:p>Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:li>
            <xhtml:li>
                <xhtml:p>Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage to reputation, loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.</xhtml:p>

                <xhtml:p>Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.</xhtml:p>
            </xhtml:li>
        </xhtml:ol>
        <xhtml:p>Retention of Intellectual Property Rights; Limitations on Distribution.</xhtml:p>

We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>Special Rules.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>The distribution of the NSA Security Recommendations is subject to the terms of the NSA Legal Notice and the terms contained in the NSA Security Recommendations themselves (<xhtml:a href="http://nsa2.www.conxion.com/cisco/notice.htm">http://nsa2.www.conxion.com/cisco/notice.htm</xhtml:a>).</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.

      FROM THE TOMCAT DOCS:
        Throughout the docs, you'll notice there are numerous references to $CATALINA_HOME. 
        This represents the root of your Tomcat installation. When we say, "This information 
        can be found in your $CATALINA_HOME/README.txt file" we mean to look at the README.txt 
        file at the root of your Tomcat install. Optionally, Tomcat may be configured for 
        multiple instances by defining $CATALINA_BASE for ___each instance___. If multiple 
        instances are not configured, $CATALINA_BASE is the same as $CATALINA_HOME.
