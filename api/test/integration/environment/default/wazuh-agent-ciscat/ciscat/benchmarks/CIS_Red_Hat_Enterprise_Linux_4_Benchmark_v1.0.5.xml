  <xccdf:title>CIS Red Hat 4 and Fedora Core 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Benchmark</xccdf:title>
  <xccdf:description>This benchmark was developed and tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) including RHEL 2.1, RHEL 3.0, RHEL 4.0, and Fedora Core 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. It is likely to work for other Linux distributions – especially Red Hat and Fedora derivatives - as well. The scoring tool may not run or may yield inaccurate results on non-RHEL and non-Fedora systems.</xccdf:description>
  <xccdf:notice id="terms-of-use" xml:lang="en">
    BACKGROUND.
    
    The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.  Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.  The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.  Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.  The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
    
    NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
    
    CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of  the Products or the Recommendations.  CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.  
    
    USER AGREEMENTS.
    
    By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
    
    1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
    2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
    3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
    4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
    5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
    6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
    
    GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
    
    CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
    
    1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
    2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
    
    RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
    
    The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.  We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.  CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
    Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.  We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
    We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.  We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. 
    
    SPECIAL RULES.
    
    CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.  Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
    CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.  Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
    CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
    
    We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    
    BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.

          <xhtml:strong>Update system per your Enterprise Update procedures. For non-enterprise environments, and or environments
                        without a formal update procedure use either up2date which is typically used for Red Hat Enterprise and yum is
                        commonly used for Fedora Core systems. Red Hat Enterprise: up2date –u Fedora Core: yum update</xhtml:strong>
        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Developing a procedure for keeping up-to-date with vendor patches is critical for the security and reliability of
                    the system. Vendors issue operating system updates when they become aware of security vulnerabilities and other serious
                    functionality issues, but it is up to their customers to actually download and install these patches.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>When Red Hat publishes an update, they include the procedures with it for updating the package. This usually
                    entails downloading the new RPMs from Red Hat, and making them available to the individual servers. Some Enterprises
                    make these packages available over an NFS share or an internal anonymous FTP/HTTP server - your Enterprise may follow
                    this practice or do something different.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>It is also important to observe that your applications work properly after patching. Though problems in patches are
                    quite rare in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it is generally recommended that any patch be deployed to a non-production
                    system first for testing.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Some RPMs may need to be installed before others. For the most part, RPM understands and solves dependencies. Red
                    Hat creates separate instructions for special cases, like the replacement of the kernel or the general C library glibc.
                    You may need to examine the list of updates that you have downloaded to check for any of these cases.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Finally, there is some risk to using a non-patched, non-hardened machine to download the patches, as this involves
                    connecting a system with security vulnerabilities on a network, which is not an Industry Best Practice. Please consider
                    these issues carefully.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Red Hat offers at least partially automated patch download and installation, via Red
                    Hat<xhtml:code>up2date</xhtml:code>. In lieu of an existing Enterprise Standard, consider installing
                        either<xhtml:code>up2date</xhtml:code>(Red Hat Enterprise Linux) or<xhtml:code>yum</xhtml:code>(Fedora Core) now,
                    and using it whenever Red Hat announces a vulnerability. If your Enterprise has several servers, consider installing an
                    update server that can be used in place of Red Hat's<xhtml:code>up2date</xhtml:code>servers - the updates will go much
                    faster, you will use much less bandwidth from your ISP, and you will reduce the load on Red Hat's servers.
                        If<xhtml:code>up2date</xhtml:code>/<xhtml:code>yum</xhtml:code>is used, it should be used on a lab server and the
                    patches validated and the system regression tested before going to live/production systems. For Fedora Core systems
                    there is a chkconfig script which if enabled, will perform nightly yum updates.</xhtml:p>

                    detected due to departures from the normal system performance curve. Note that this data is only archived for one week

        <xhtml:p>Bastille is a series of perl scripts that ask you questions and hardens your machine based on the answers. The

        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>In this benchmark, it was decided it is better to direct you to use Bastille rather than incorporate their
                    procedures into this document. This provides fair credit to an excellent resource, and reduces the maintenance effort
                    involved to keep this Benchmark up to date.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Appendix C discusses the rationale behind all of the answers used in the configuration file.</xhtml:p>

                    SUID bit (<xhtml:code>chmod 4755</xhtml:code>) after running Bastille. A complete list of files changed is in Appendix

      <xccdf:title>Configure TCP Wrappers and Firewall to Limit Access</xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>TCP Wrappers and Host-Based Firewalls are presented together as they are similar and complementary in
                    functionality.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:u>TCP Wrappers</xhtml:u>
        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>By limiting access to the server, you reduce your exposure to threats from attackers on remote systems. For
                    Internet-connected servers that provide service to the whole Internet, limiting access may not make sense. Intranet
                    servers, limited-access servers, and workstations should limit access to only authorized networks.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Many daemons (SSH for example) are compiled with TCP Wrapper support, so you can
                        use<xhtml:code>/etc/hosts.allow</xhtml:code>and<xhtml:code>/etc/hosts.deny</xhtml:code>to limit SSH access to your
                    systems. The portmap daemon also uses TCP wrappers and there is a specific note to this effect in the default TCP
                    wrappers config files.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>It is important to note that TCP wrappers looks at<xhtml:code>hosts.allow</xhtml:code>first,
                        then<xhtml:code>hosts.deny</xhtml:code>, and controls access based on the first match. If you omit entries
                        in<xhtml:code>hosts.allow</xhtml:code>and deny access to ALL in<xhtml:code>hosts.deny</xhtml:code>, you will block
                    network access to all network clients.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>
          <xhtml:u>Host-Based Firewalls</xhtml:u>
        </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Host-based firewalls (also known as personal firewalls) have the following benefits:</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:blockquote>Protection from compromised systems on the local network;</xhtml:blockquote>
        <xhtml:blockquote>Defense in depth where an attacker must overcome both the border firewall and the host-based firewall to
                    attack a system;</xhtml:blockquote>
        <xhtml:blockquote>Extremely fine tuned control over what systems may or may not access the system.</xhtml:blockquote>
        <xhtml:p>The Center for Internet Security recommends installing a host-based firewall on workstations, and suggests
                    end-users consider installing them on servers as well.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Workstations are defined as Linux systems that offer no services to any external network or system. For example, a
                    workstation that is running Apache and serving up content to the local network segment is not a workstation.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Host-based firewalls are available in iptables (installed by default) or via commercial offerings. The Center for
                    Internet Security makes no recommendations for a vendor or even a specific firewall configuration as firewalls are very
                    complex systems. Entire books have been written on iptables and are outside the scope of this benchmark. The default Red
                    Hat iptables configuration or the default Bastille Linux iptables configuration are suitable for workstations and are
                    good starting points for servers. The Center for Internet Security does recommend using a tool (graphical- or
                    text-based) to configure the firewall as manual rule configuration is extremely error-prone and you may end up with a
                    false sense of security and have less secure system.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>telnet uses an unencrypted network protocol, which means data from the login session 
        (such as passwords and all other data transmitted during the session) can be stolen by 
        eavesdroppers on the network, and also that the session can be hijacked by outsiders to 
        gain access to the remote system. The freely-available SSH utilities that ship with Red 
        Hat Linux (see http://www.openssh.com/) provide encrypted network logins and should 
        be used instead.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>To aid in the migration to SSH, there is a freely available SSH client for Windows called 
        putty, which is available from Simon Tatham (see 
        http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/).  There are numerous commercially 
        supported SSH clients as well – check to see if your Enterprise already has an Enterprise 
        SSH client.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>Some Enterprises are using telnet over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard 
        solution is to use SSH.  Configuring telnet over SSL is beyond the scope of a Level 1 
        Benchmark and will not be addressed here.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>It is understood that large Enterprises deeply entrenched in using telnet may take 
        12 CIS Red Hat Enterprise Linux Benchmark  
        considerable effort in migrating from telnet to ssh, so telnet may have to be 
        enabled.  When it can be disabled, simply run chkconfig telnet off to turn it off 
        again.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Note: Red Hat switched from distributing wu-ftpd to vsftpd after RHEL2.1 was 
        released.  For security reasons, as well as consistency with future Red Hat versions, you 
        should consider replacing wu-ftpd with vsftpd.  vsftpd is available from the Red 
        Hat Enterprise Linux updates as well as from the Fedora Core distribution.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>Like telnet, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means passwords and other data 
        transmitted during the session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the FTP 
        session itself can be hijacked by an external attacker.  Anonymous FTP servers are 
        common are for providing fast and easy downloading of publicly available files, however 
        anonymous access should be configured to not allow uploading of files to the ftp server. 
        FTP servers are also commonly used for Web Servers, but should be replaced by sftp if 
        possible.  Ftp / sftp access should be chrooted to include the document root of the web 
        site or the portion of the web site that the individual is responsible for.  Of course access 
        to the system configuration files and other web files is to be excluded from the chrooted 
        environment. This is especially important if there are multiple web sites.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>SSH provides two different encrypted file transfer mechanisms – scp and sftp – which 
        should be used instead. Even if FTP is required, consider requiring non-anonymous users 
        on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. For further information on 
        restricting FTP access to the system, see section 7.2 below.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>Note: Any directory writable by an anonymous FTP server should have its own partition. 
        This helps prevent an FTP server from filling a hard drive used by other services.  
        To aid in the migration away from FTP, there are a number of freely available scp and 
        sftp client for Windows, such as  FileZilla from  http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla  
        and WinSCP available from http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php which provides 
        for a Graphical interface to putty, and pscp, which is a part of the previously mentioned 
        putty package.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>Some Enterprises are using FTP over SSL, however, the simpler and more standard 
        solution is to use SSH.  Configuring FTP over SSL is beyond the scope of a Level 1

        <xhtml:p>The r-commands suffer from the same hijacking and sniffing issues as telnet and ftp, and 
          in addition have a number of well-known weaknesses in their authentication scheme.  
          SSH was designed to be a drop-in replacement for these protocols. Given the wide 
          availability of free SSH implementations, it seems unlikely that there is ever a case where 
          these tools cannot be replaced with SSH (again, see http://www.openssh.com/).  
          If these protocols are left enabled, please also see section 7.1 for additional security-
          related configuration settings.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>It is possible to run a Unix system with the Sendmail daemon disabled and still allow 
          users on that system to send email out from that machine. Running Sendmail in "daemon 
          mode" (with the -bd command-line option) is only required on machines that act as mail 
          servers, receiving and processing email from other hosts on the network. Note that if the 
          system is an email server, the administrator is encouraged to search the Web for 
          additional documentation on Sendmail security issues. Some information is available at 
          http://www.deer-run.com/~hal/dns-sendmail/DNSandSendmail.pdf and at 
          http://www.sendmail.org.</xhtml:p>
        
         <xhtml:p>Although recent versions of Red Hat have set Sendmail to listen only to the loopback 
          network interface, this document still deactivates "daemon mode."  Listening on the 
          loopback interface still presents a slightly higher level of exposure to attack than not 
          listening at all.  Experienced administrators will understand that a chroot-jailed user or 
          program can still interact with a Sendmail process listening on the loopback interface.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>There is usually no reason to run X Windows on a dedicated server machine, like a 
          dedicated web server. This action disables the graphical login, if present, leaving the user 
          to login via SSH or a normal text-based console. If you elect to deactivate the GUI login 
          screen, users can still run X Windows by typing startx at the shell prompt. In Red Hat 
          Enterprise Linux, there are two main runlevels that the system runs in. Runlevel 5 boots 
          directly into X Windows, so as to allow graphical login or easy use of specialized X 
          terminals. Otherwise, for normal text-based console login, runlevel 3 is desirable. GUI 
          login is activated or deactivated by changing this runlevel in /etc/inittab. Again, 
          note that runlevel 3 still allows the user to run X Windows by typing startx at the shell

        <xhtml:p>Every system daemon that does not have a clear and necessary purpose on the host should be deactivated. This
                    greatly reduces the chances that the machine will be running a vulnerable daemon when the next vulnerability is
                    discovered in its operating system.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Red Hat Linux uses a facility called<xhtml:code>chkconfig</xhtml:code>to manage all the SysV
                        rc-scripts.<xhtml:code>chkconfig</xhtml:code>adds or deletes links in each of the appropriate runlevel directories
                        (<xhtml:code>/etc/rc.d/rc*.d</xhtml:code>) to activate or deactivate each of the rc-scripts.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>This process "<xhtml:code>chkconfig</xhtml:code>'s" all of the rc-scripts off, so that the local administrator can
                    easily reactivate any of these scripts upon discovery of a mission-critical need for one of these services. One could
                    reactivate the daemon script by typing<xhtml:code>chkconfig daemon</xhtml:code>on in most cases, which activates it in
                    runlevels 2 through 5. If one of these runlevels is undesirable, like runlevel 2 for the NFS script, or the script needs
                    to run in one of the other available runlevels,<xhtml:code>chkconfig</xhtml:code>takes the argument "level
                    &lt;levels&gt;" where one can explicitly specify runlevels that it should act on.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Note that vendor patches may restore some of the original entries in the startup script
                        directories<xhtml:code>/etc/rc.d/rc*.d</xhtml:code>- it is always a good idea to check these boot directories and
                    remove any scripts that may have been added by the patch installation process. This would be a good time to ensure this
                    check is in your Enterprise OS Upgrade Procedure.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain services - in
                    particular, the services that are disabled in the second loop in the "Action" section above. Rather than disabling and
                    then re-enabling these services, experienced administrators may wish to simply disable only those services that they
                    know are unnecessary for their systems.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>The third loop in the "Action" section locks daemon-user accounts related to servers that we examine by setting a
                    lockout password. This will not prevent a given daemon from running as these users - it simply confirms that these users
                    are not available for human login. It also changes the shell to<xhtml:code>/dev/null</xhtml:code>for an additional layer
                    of security as long as shell access is not necessary. Bear in mind that some packages
                    (<xhtml:code>find-utils</xhtml:code>up to version 4.1.20, for example) do not work properly without a shell for
                        the<xhtml:code>nobody</xhtml:code>account - be sure you test this thoroughly if you choose to invalidate the daemon
                    shells.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Note: Not all of the scripts listed above will exist on all systems, as this is a superset of the available
                    rc-scripts in the various Red Hat distribution versions. The benchmark's recommended action will register some trivial
                    errors on each distribution version as a result - these are not cause for alarm.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Red Hat Linux includes the popular Open Source Samba server for providing file and

          (authentication server) to older Windows operating systems. However, if this

        <xhtml:p>NFS is frequently exploited to gain unauthorized access to files and systems. Clearly 
          there is no need to run the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. 
          If the system is an NFS server, the administrator should take reasonable precautions when 
          exporting file systems, including restricting NFS access to a specific range of local IP 
          addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" where appropriate. For more 
          information, consult the exports manual page.</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Most of the machines in the organization do not need a DNS server running on the box. 
        Unless this is one of the organization's name servers, it is safe to shut this down.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>If this must be left active, please patch often and security harden the configuration 
          according to the CIS BIND benchmark which provides detailed implementation and 
          configurations recommendations. Two highly suggested configuration is to bind the DNS 
          server program in a chroot environment, and run it as a non-root user. This significantly 
          restricts the resources that the DNS server has access to on the system, reducing this set 
          to the minimum required for the program to function properly. Carefully consider the 
          consequences that if a name server is compromised then traffic that depends on the name 
          service such as web, ftp and e-mail can be redirected to malicious servers.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>Additionally, consider the use of Access Control Lists (ACL's) in /etc/named.conf 
          to limit who can query your name server.  For example, Internal name servers should not 
          respond to outside requests.  Large Enterprises run multiple name servers so this should 
          not be an issue.  However, smaller organizations may not be able to deploy both internal 
          and external name servers and should instead use an reputable externally hosted DNS 
          service.  Details on how to accomplish this are provided in the CIS BIND benchmark, 
          available at http://www.cisecurity.org/bench_bind.html</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>Squid can actually be beneficial to security, as it imposes a proxy between the client and 
          server. On the other hand, if it is not being used, it should be deactivated and removed. 
          This deactivation decreases the risk of system compromise should a security vulnerability 
          later be discovered in Squid. Finally, if your site uses Squid, configure it carefully. Many 
          Squid caches are badly configured to either allow outsider attackers to probe internal 
          machines through the firewall or to use the cache to hide their true source IP address from 
          their target hosts. Each site should configure Squid to not allow people outside their 
          perimeter to use the cache without authentication of some sort. A better deployment for 
          squid is on a server with no external-facing network interface (unless you are using it for 
          a reverse web proxy, which is a very specific installation, and beyond the scope of this 
          benchmark).</xhtml:p>

        <xhtml:p>Kudzu is Red Hat's hardware detection program, which is normally set to run during

          any sort, allows the user at the console to configure that hardware. This lack of 
          authentication presents the primary danger – any user sitting at the console during a 
          reboot can configure any new devices added to the system.</xhtml:p>
        
        <xhtml:p>This configuration is an unnecessary risk for most sites, with the exception of those that 
          need to allow users to easily make hardware changes without having a root password.

    <xccdf:description>The items in this section cover enabling various different forms of system logging in order to keep track of
            activity on the system. Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly
            after a security incident) experts recommend establishing some form of time synchronization among systems and devices connected
            to the local network. The standard Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is
            supported by most network-ready devices. More information on NTP can be found at<xhtml:a href="http://www.ntp.org">http://www.ntp.org</xhtml:a>and<xhtml:a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/otherformats/html_single/TimePrecision-HOWTO.html">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/otherformats/html_single/TimePrecision-HOWTO.html</xhtml:a>.</xccdf:description>

        <xhtml:p>Not all Linux distributions, especially the older ones, capture logging information which is sent to the

                    these channels (e.g., successful and failed su attempts, failed login attempts, root login attempts, etc). The above
                    action causes this information to be captured in the<xhtml:code>/var/log/secure</xhtml:code>file (which is only readable

      <xccdf:title>Disable USB Devices (AKA Hotplugger)</xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>PCMCIA cards, USB drives and memory devices represent another attack vector against 
          your systems.  The prices for a 512MB or even 1GB USB memory device have become 
          very affordable, and is enough storage to transport vast quantities of data off a system.  
          Few servers have any need for PCMCIA or USB devices and this whole avenue should 
          be disabled.</xhtml:p> 
        <xhtml:p>Another possible attack would be to have a bootable Linux system installed on the USB 
          device.  Most modern BIOS' allow booting from USB devices, so this would let a person 
          with physical access to a server an extremely easy way take over a system and bypass 
          some of the security you are setting up.  See the discussion regarding floppy and CD-
          ROM drives in section 6.2.</xhtml:p> 
        <xhtml:p>For these reasons, you should also disable USB in the BIOS if possible. 
          Note: For RHEL4 and Fedora Core 4, hotplugger is required by udev, which is required 
          by several other required packages, making very unlikely that you will be able to remove 
          it.  Therefore for new RedHat versions (RHEL4 and Fedora Core 4-5) the nousb kernel 
          boot argument should be to disable usb devices.  The script above uses grubby to add the 
          nousb kernel boot argument to the default kernel image. Adding nousb to other kernel 
          images is also recommended.   The /etc/grub.conf symbolic link may also be viewed or 
          edited as well.  The nousb  argument is placed at the end of the lines starting with 
          kernel, as shown below.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>Used in conjunction with the BSD-style "r-commands" (<xhtml:code>rlogin, rsh, rcp</xhtml:code>),
                        the<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>files implement a weak form of authentication based on the network address or
                    host name of the remote computer (which can be spoofed by a potential attacker to exploit the local system).
                        Disabling<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>support helps prevent users from subverting the system's normal access
                    control mechanisms.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>If<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>support is required for some reason, some basic precautions should be taken when
                    creating and managing<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>files. Never use the "+" wildcard character
                    in<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>files. In fact,<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>entries should always specify a
                    specific trusted host name along with the user name of the trusted account on that system (e.g.,
                        "<xhtml:code>trustedhost alice</xhtml:code>" and not just "<xhtml:code>trustedhost</xhtml:code>"). Avoid
                    establishing trust relationships with systems outside of the organization's security perimeter and/or systems not
                    controlled by the local administrative staff. Firewalls and other network security elements should actually
                        block<xhtml:code>rlogin/rsh/rcp</xhtml:code>access from external hosts.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>Finally, make sure that<xhtml:code>.rhosts</xhtml:code>files are only readable by the owner of the file (i.e.,
                    these files should be mode<xhtml:code>600</xhtml:code>).</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:title>Prevent X Server From Listening On Port 6000/tcp</xccdf:title>
      <xccdf:description>X servers listen on port<xhtml:code>6000/tcp</xhtml:code>for messages from remote clients running on other
                systems. However, X Windows uses a relatively insecure authentication protocol and an attacker who is able to gain
                unauthorized access to the local X server can easily compromise the system. Invoking the "<xhtml:code>-nolisten
                tcp</xhtml:code>" option causes the X server not to listen on port 6000/tcp by default. This prevents authorized remote X
                clients from displaying windows on the local system as well. However, the forwarding of X events via SSH will still happen
                normally. This is the preferred and more secure method transmitting results from remote X clients in any event.</xccdf:description>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>By default on Red Hat Linux, you can enter single user mode simply by typing "linux single" at the LILO prompt or
                    in the GRUB boot-editing menu. Some believe that this is left in to ease support of users with lost root passwords. In
                    any case, it represents a clear security risk - authentication should always be required for root-level access. It
                    should be noted that it is extremely difficult to prevent compromise by any attacker who has knowledge, tools, and full
                    physical access to a system. This kind of measure simply increases the difficulty of compromise by requiring more of
                    each of these factors.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:br/>
        <xhtml:p>These last two items have attempted to address concerns of physical/boot security. To make these preparations more
                    complete, one should consider setting the BIOS to boot only from the main hard disk and locking this setting with a BIOS
                    password. For more information on reducing the threat posed by an attacker with physical/boot access, consider the
                    article "Anyone with a Screwdriver Can Break In," available at<xhtml:a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html">http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html</xhtml:a>.</xhtml:p>

      <xccdf:description>These accounts are non-human system accounts that should be made less useful to an attacker by locking them
                and setting the shell to a shell not in /etc/shells. They can even be deleted if the machines does not use the
                daemon/service that each is responsible for, though it is safest to simply deactivate them as is done here. To deactivate
                them, lock the password and set the login shell to an invalid shell. /dev/null is a good choice because it is not a valid
                login shell, and should an attacker attempt to replace it with a copy of a valid shell the system will not operate properly.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/>This section expands upon section 3.6 for locking out users.</xccdf:description>

      <xccdf:description>It is a good idea to force users to change passwords on a regular basis. The commands above will set all
                active accounts (except the root account) to force password changes every 90 days, and then prevent password changes for
                seven days thereafter. Users will begin receiving warnings 28 days before their password expires. The Enterprise also has
                the option of expiring idle accounts after a certain number of days (see the on-line manual page for
                the<xhtml:code>usermod</xhtml:code>command, particularly the<xhtml:code>-f</xhtml:code>option). Finally, the instructions
                above set a minimum password length of 6 characters.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/>These are recommended starting values. Some regulated industries require more restrictive values - ensure they
                comply with your Enterprise security policy.</xccdf:description>

      <xccdf:description>With a default<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>setting of<xhtml:code>077</xhtml:code>- a setting agreed to as
                part of the consensus process with DISA and NSA - files and directories created by users will not be readable by any other
                user on the system. The user creating the file has the discretion of making their files and directories readable by others
                via the<xhtml:code>chmod</xhtml:code>command. Users who wish to allow their files and directories to be readable by others
                by default may choose a different default<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>by inserting the<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>command
                into the standard shell configuration files (<xhtml:code>.profile</xhtml:code>,<xhtml:code>.cshrc</xhtml:code>, etc.) in
                their home directories. A<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>of<xhtml:code>027</xhtml:code>would make files and directories
                readable by users in the same Unix group, while a<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>of<xhtml:code>022</xhtml:code>would make
                files readable by every user on the system.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/>We adjust root's<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>setting separately in this item, as root shells don't necessarily
                read the system-wide configuration files. For example, root sessions using bash doesn't
                get<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>settings from<xhtml:code>/etc/profile</xhtml:code>.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/>Note: This is been shown to cause problems with the installation of software packages where the installation
                script uses the default<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>- the directories are owned by root
                with<xhtml:code>700</xhtml:code>permissions, and then the application and/or daemon cannot read its files. A simple fix to
                this problem is to manually issue a less restrictive<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>(such as<xhtml:code>umask
                022</xhtml:code>) for the shell session doing the installation, or place such a<xhtml:code>umask</xhtml:code>command in the
                beginning to a less restrictive value before the installation, or in the beginning of the installation script.</xccdf:description>

    <xccdf:description>Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of
            trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version
            information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific attacks at a system (though there
            are other mechanisms available for acquiring this information). Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require
            that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to
            monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such
            monitoring. Clearly, the organization's local legal counsel and/or site security administrator should review the content of all
            messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are inherently site- specific.<xhtml:br/><xhtml:br/>More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at<xhtml:a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/s%26sappendix2002.htm">http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/s%26sappendix2002.htm</xhtml:a>.</xccdf:description>
