    BACKGROUND.
    
    The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.  Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.  The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.  Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.  The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
    
    NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
    
    CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of  the Products or the Recommendations.  CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.  
    
    USER AGREEMENTS.
    
    By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
    
    1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
    2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
    3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
    4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
    5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
    6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
    
    GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
    
    CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
    
    1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
    2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
    
    RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
    
    The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.  We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.  CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
    Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.  We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
    We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.  We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. 
    
    SPECIAL RULES.
        
    CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.  Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
    CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.  Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
    CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
    
    We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    
    BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.

      <htm:b>Conventions</htm:b>
      <htm:br/> The following typographical conventions are used in this document:<htm:br/><htm:table><htm:tr><htm:td>Roman font</htm:td><htm:td>normal text</htm:td></htm:tr><htm:tr><htm:td><htm:code>Courier</htm:code></htm:td><htm:td><htm:code>used to indicate either a command or a standard UNIX parameter or file.</htm:code></htm:td></htm:tr><htm:tr><htm:td><htm:i>Italics</htm:i></htm:td><htm:td><htm:i>used for a question that you must evaluate before continuing</htm:i></htm:td></htm:tr></htm:table><htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Root Shell Environment Assumed </htm:b><htm:br/> The actions listed in this document are written with the assumption that they will be executed by the root user running the bash
            shell and without <htm:code>noclobber</htm:code> set. Also, the following directories are assumed to be in root's path:
                <htm:code>/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin</htm:code><htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Executing Actions</htm:b><htm:br/><htm:br/> The actions listed in this document are written with the assumption that they will be executed in the order presented here. Some
            actions may need to be modified if the order is changed. Actions are written so that they may be copied directly from this document into a
            root shell window with a "cut-and-paste" operation. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Reboot Required</htm:b><htm:br/> Rebooting the system is required after completing all of the actions below in order to complete the re-configuration of the
            system. In many cases, the changes made in the steps below will not take effect until this reboot is performed. If substantial operating
            system updates are performed after the initial OS load, you may have to reboot more than once. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Vulnerabilities</htm:b><htm:br/> In addition to any specific issues presented by a particular service or protocol, <htm:b>every</htm:b> service has the potential
            of being an entry point into a system if a vulnerability is found. This is why we recommend that some services are disabled even though
            there is no clear way to exploit them, and there has never been a problem with the service. If you are running an unnecessary service, you
            add additional risks of a vulnerability being found in the service in the future. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Backup Key Files</htm:b><htm:br/> Before performing the steps of this benchmark it is strongly recommended that administrators make backup copies of critical
            configuration files that may get modified by various benchmark items. If this step is not performed, then the site may have no reasonable
            back-out strategy for reversing system modifications made as a result of this document. The script provided in Appendix B of this document
            will automatically back up all files that may be modified by the actions below. Note that an executable copy of this script is also
            provided in the archive containing the PDF version of this document and the CIS scoring tool. Assuming the administrator is in the
            directory where the archive has been unpacked, the command to execute the backup script would be: <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:code>./do-backup.sh </htm:code><htm:br/><htm:br/> One of the byproducts of the <htm:code>do-backup.sh</htm:code> script is <htm:code>/root/do-restore.sh</htm:code>, which is
            dynamically generated based on the results of the <htm:code>do-backup.sh</htm:code> script. To roll back the changes performed by this
            benchmark, first run <htm:code>RevertBastille</htm:code> followed by <htm:code>do-restore.sh</htm:code>, and all changes will be backed
            out. Since not all Linux installations are identical, the <htm:code>do-restore.sh</htm:code> script is created based on the files that
            actually existed at the time <htm:code>do-backup.sh</htm:code> was run. <htm:br/><htm:br/> Note: If you make any changes manually to any of the files that were preserved by do-backup.sh, those changes will be lost when
            do-restore.sh is executed. It may be prudent to delete the do-restore.sh script once you have validated the changes to prevent
            inadvertently undoing the changes. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Build Considerations</htm:b><htm:br/> If you have not done so already, plan out a partitioned hard drive. By creating a robust partition scheme an administrator can
            mitigate the threat of common local attacks, such as those based on hard links and consuming available partition space. The first step in
            achieving this is to place user-writable directory structures on a separate partition. This includes <htm:code>/home, /tmp,</htm:code> and
                <htm:code>/var/tmp</htm:code>. Additionally, any directory structure that may variably consume large quantities of disk space should
            also be placed on separate partitions. This includes <htm:code>/var/log</htm:code> and <htm:code>/var/spool/mail</htm:code>, where
            applicable. Note: Debian will download and store packages at <htm:code>/var/cache/apt/archives</htm:code>. Some administrators may find it
            easier to create a separate partition for the entire <htm:code>/var</htm:code> directory structure. To limit the inconveniences caused by
            filling up <htm:code>/home</htm:code>, consider implementing user and group quotas on the <htm:code>/home</htm:code> file system. Quotas
            will limit how much a single user (or single group) can store on a given file system. More information is available at <htm:a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/47">http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/47</htm:a>. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Software Package Removal </htm:b><htm:br/> There is considerable debate over the maintenance of unused software packages. Some people feel that as long as the software is
            not being used, leaving it installed poses no appreciable risk. Others feel that unused software presents another attack vector and
            increases the maintenance effort for the administrators. This Benchmark makes no recommendation for the removal of unused software. If
            vulnerable software is present on a system, that vulnerability may be exploitable by a local attacker, and the reader is advised to
            consider the effort in either its removal or maintenance and the risks thereof. <htm:br/><htm:br/><htm:b>Software Package Installation</htm:b><htm:br/> Throughout this Benchmark, you may be directed to enable software package init scripts using the
            <htm:code>update-rc.d</htm:code> command. This assumes you already installed said package(s). If the <htm:code>update-rc.d</htm:code>
            command fails, verify you actually installed the software required. <htm:br/><htm:br/></htm:p>

                    password will reduce the exposure of a system compromise via physical access. However, establishing a BIOS password has the
                    potentially negative effect of limiting the ability to remotely reboot the server. Some BIOS' may be configured to require a
                    password upon modifying the BIOS but not upon boot; this is the preferred settings. </htm:p>

        <htm:p> An additional countermeasure to slightly mitigate the threat of a physical attack is configuring the BIOS boot sequence. One
                    can accomplish this by disabling the server's ability to boot off all non-harddisk devices, including floppy, CD-ROM, and USB.

      <cdf:title>Create a Robust Partition Scheme</cdf:title>
      <cdf:description>
        <htm:p> By creating a robust partition scheme an administrator can mitigate the threat of common local attacks, such as those based on
                    hardlinks and consuming available partition space. The first step in achieving this is to place user-writable directory structures
                    on a seperate partition. This includes <htm:code>/home</htm:code>, <htm:code>/tmp</htm:code>, and <htm:code>/var/tmp</htm:code>.
                    Additionally, any directory structure that may variabley consume large quantities of disk space should also be placed on seperate
                    partitions. This includes <htm:code>/var/log</htm:code> and <htm:code>/var/spool/mail</htm:code>, where applicable. Note: Debian
                    will download and store packages at <htm:code>/var/cache/apt/archives</htm:code>. <htm:p>Minimally, the following conditions
                        should must exist:</htm:p><htm:ul><htm:li>user writable directories (i.e /tmp) should have their own partitions to prevent hardlink attacks</htm:li><htm:li>/var and /opt should should not share a partition with the system root '/'</htm:li><htm:li>/var and /opt should should not share a partition with the system root '/'</htm:li></htm:ul><htm:br/><htm:p> To limit the inconveniences caused by filling up /home, consider implementing user and group quotas on the /home file
                        system. Quotas will limit how much a single user (or single group) can store on a given file system </htm:p></htm:p>

      <cdf:title>File System Considerations</cdf:title>
      <cdf:description>
        <htm:p> Depending on the role of the server, the file system may have a significant impact on performance and availability. By
                    default, the Debian installer will select a journalling file system, <htm:code>ext3</htm:code>. This file system is generally
                    recommended in most scenarios as it increases system availability and data integrity in the event of a system crash by requiring
                    less time to perform file system checks and by ensuring that file data updates are flushed to disk before any transactions commit.
                    A potential downfall to the <htm:code>ext3</htm:code> file system is a reduced ability to recover deleted files via
                        <htm:code>undelete</htm:code> or <htm:code>debugfs</htm:code>. </htm:p>

        <htm:p>Developing a procedure for keeping up-to-date with vendor patches is critical for the security and reliability of the system.
                    Vendors issue operating system updates when they become aware of security vulnerabilities and other serious functionality issues,
                    but it is up to their customers to actually download and install these patches.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>When Debian publishes an update, they include the procedures with it for updating the package. This usually entails downloading
                    the new packages (.deb) from Debian, and making them available to the individual servers. Some enterprises make these packages
                    available over an NFS share or an internal anonymous FTP/HTTP server - your enterprise may follow this practice or do something
                    different.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>It is also important to observe that your applications work properly after patching. Though problems in patches are quite rare
                    in Debian Linux 3.1, it is generally recommended that any patch be deployed to a non-production system first for testing.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>Finally, there is some risk to using a non-patched, non-hardened machine to download the patches, as this involves connecting a
                    system with security vulnerabilities on a network, which is not an industry best practice. Please consider these issues carefully.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>Debian offers at least partially automated patch download and installation, via <htm:code>apt-get</htm:code> and
                        <htm:code>aptitude</htm:code>. Consider using <htm:code>apt-get</htm:code> or <htm:code>aptitude</htm:code> whenever Debian
                    announces a vulnerability. If your enterprise has several servers, consider installing an update server that can be used in place
                    of Debian's package servers - the updates will go much faster, you will use much less bandwidth from your ISP, and you will reduce
                    the load on Debian's servers. This can be accomplished via <htm:code>apt-proxy</htm:code>, <htm:code>apt-mirror</htm:code>, or
                        <htm:code>apt-move</htm:code>. It is recommended that patches be validated and functionality regressed in a lab environment
                    before applying to live/production systems.</htm:p>

        <htm:p>System accounting gathers baseline system data (CPU utilization, disk I/O, etc.) every 10 minutes. The data may be accessed
                    with the <htm:code>sar</htm:code> command, or by reviewing the nightly report files named
                    <htm:code>/var/log/sysstat/sar*</htm:code>. Once a normal baseline for the system has been established, unauthorized activity
                    (password crackers and other CPU-intensive jobs,and activity outside of normal usage hours) may be detected due to departures from
                    the normal system performance curve. Note that this data is only archived for one week before being automatically removed by the
                    regular nightly cron job. Administrators may wish to archive the <htm:code>/var/log/sysstat/</htm:code> directory on a regular
                    basis to preserve this data for longer periods.</htm:p>

                    then walk you through opening up your system for the services that have a legitimate business need.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>In this benchmark, it was decided it is better to direct you to use Bastille rather than incorporate their procedures into this
                    document. This provides fair credit to an excellent resource, and reduces the maintenance effort involved to keep this Benchmark
                    up to date. Appendix C discusses the rationale behind all of the answers used in the configuration file.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>After Bastille is installed, copy the bastille.CIS.conf file provided in the archive containing the PDF version of this

                    then you will have to restore the SUID bit (<htm:code>chmod 4755</htm:code>) after running Bastille. A complete list of files
                    changed is in Appendix B. Before running Bastille, please review Appendix C and understand the changes that it will make. The
                    following commands will install Bastille, copy the CIS configuration file to the appropriate location, execute Bastille, which
                    will commit changes to your system, and finally reboot. Rebooting is required as many services are disabled by Bastille and the
                    remainder of the Benchmark is based on this environment.</htm:p>

        <htm:p>By limiting access to the server, you reduce your exposure to threats from attackers on remote systems. For Internet-connected
                    servers that provide service to the whole Internet, limiting access may not make sense. Intranet servers, limited-access servers,
                    and workstations should limit access to only authorized networks. Many daemons (SSH for example) are compiled with TCP Wrapper
                    support, so you can use <htm:code>/etc/hosts.allow</htm:code> and <htm:code>/etc/hosts.deny</htm:code> to limit SSH access to your
                    systems. It is important to note that TCP wrappers looks at <htm:code>hosts.allow</htm:code> first, then
                    <htm:code>hosts.deny</htm:code>, and controls access based on the first match. If you omit entries in
                    <htm:code>hosts.allow</htm:code> and deny access to ALL in <htm:code>hosts.deny</htm:code>, you will block network access to all
                    network clients.</htm:p>

        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>Like <htm:cdoe>telnet</htm:cdoe>, the FTP protocol is unencrypted, which means passwords and other data transmitted during the
                    session can be captured by sniffing the network, and that the FTP session itself can be hijacked by an external attacker.
                    Anonymous FTP servers are common are for providing fast and easy downloading of publicly available files, however anonymous access
                    should be configured to not allow uploading of files to the ftp server. FTP servers are also commonly used for Web Servers, but
                    should be replaced by SFTP if possible. FTP / SFTP access should be chrooted to include the document root of the web site or the
                    portion of the web site that the individual is responsible for. Of course, access to the system configuration files and other web
                    files is to be excluded from the chrooted environment. This is especially important if there are multiple web sites.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>SSH provides two different encrypted file transfer mechanisms – scp and sftp – which should be used instead. Even if FTP is
                    required, consider requiring non-anonymous users on the system to transfer files via SSH-based protocols. </htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>To aid in the migration away from FTP, there are a number of freely available scp and sftp client for Windows, such as
                    FileZilla from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla">http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla</a> and WinSCP
                    available from <a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php">http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/index.php</a> which
                    provides for a Graphical interface to putty, and pscp, which is a part of the previously mentioned putty package.</htm:p>
        <htm:br/>
        <htm:p>Note: Any directory writable by an anonymous FTP server should have its own partition. This helps prevent an FTP server from
                    filling a hard drive used by other services.</htm:p>

                    provides detailed implementation and configurations recommendations. Two highly suggested configuration is to bind the DNS server
                    program in a chroot environment, and run it as a non-root user. This significantly restricts the resources that the DNS server has
                    access to on the system, reducing this set to the minimum required for the program to function properly. Carefully consider the
                    consequences that if a name server is compromised then traffic that depends on the name service such as web, ftp, and e-mail can
                    be redirected to malicious servers.</htm:p><htm:br/><htm:p>Additionally, consider the use of Access Control Lists (ACL's) in <htm:code>/etc/bind/named.conf</htm:code> to limit who can
                    query your name server. For example, Internal name servers should not respond to outside requests. Large enterprises run multiple
                    name servers so this should not be an issue. However, smaller organizations may not be able to deploy both internal and external
                    name servers and should instead use an reputable externally hosted DNS service. Details on how to accomplish this are provided in

On the other hand, if it is
                    not being used, it should be deactivated and removed. This deactivation decreases the risk of system compromise should a security
                    vulnerability later be discovered in Squid. Finally, if your site uses Squid, configure it carefully. Many Squid caches are badly
                    configured to either allow outsider attackers to probe internal machines through the firewall or to use the cache to hide their
                    true source IP address from their target hosts. Each site should configure Squid to not allow people outside their perimeter to
                    use the cache without authentication of some sort. A better deployment for squid is on a server with no external-facing network
                    interface (unless you are using it for a reverse web proxy, which is a very specific installation, and beyond the scope of this

    <cdf:description> The items in this section cover enabling various forms of system logging in order to keep track of activity on the system.
            Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems (particularly after a security incident) experts
            recommend establishing some form of time synchronization among systems and devices connected to the local network. The standard Internet
            protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is supported by most network-ready devices. More information
            on NTP can be found at <htm:a href="http://www.ntp.org">http://www.ntp.org</htm:a> and <htm:a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/otherformats/html_single/TimePrecision-HOWTO.html">http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/otherformats/html_single/TimePrecision-HOWTO.html</htm:a>. </cdf:description>

        <htm:p>The default installation of Debian Linux already has this enabled. It is included in case it had been previously
                    disabled.<htm:br/><htm:br/>Not all Linux distributions, especially the older ones, capture logging information which is sent to
                    the LOG_AUTHPRIV facilities. This is unfortunate, since a great deal of important security-related information is sent via these
                    channels (e.g., network service startups, commands like usermod and chage, etc). The above action causes this information to be
                    captured in the /var/log/auth.log file (which is only readable by the superuser). This file should be reviewed and archived on a
                    regular basis.</htm:p>

        <htm:p>When the so-called "sticky bit" is set on a directory, then only the owner of a file may remove that file from the directory
                    (as opposed to the usual behavior where anybody with write access to that directory may remove the file). Setting the sticky bit
                    prevents users from overwriting each other's files, whether accidentally or maliciously, and is generally appropriate for most
                    world-writable directories. However, consult appropriate vendor documentation before blindly applying the sticky bit to any world
                    writable directories found in order to avoid breaking any application dependencies on a given directory.<htm:br/></htm:p>

                    improper package maintenance/installation. Sometimes a package removal results in unowned files or directories related to this
                    software as the user/group associated with that package is removed, but that user's files (i.e., files changed after the package
                    was installed) are left behind. Another common cause is the installation of software that does not properly set file
                    ownerships.<htm:br/><htm:br/>Files in any NFS mounts may be ignored as the user ID mapping between systems may be out of sync. If
                    your enterprise uses a central user management system (NIS or LDAP), the presence of unowned files may indicate another problem

        <htm:p>Used in conjunction with the BSD-style "r-commands" (rlogin, rsh, rcp), the .rhosts files implement a weak form of
                    authentication based on the network address or host name of the remote computer (which can be spoofed by a potential attacker to
                    exploit the local system). Disabling .rhosts support helps prevent users from subverting the system's normal access control
                    mechanisms.<htm:br/><htm:br/> If .rhosts support is required for some reason, some basic precautions should be taken when creating
                    and managing .rhosts files. Never use the "+" wildcard character in .rhosts files. In fact, .rhosts entries should always specify
                    a specific trusted host name along with the user name of the trusted account on that system (e.g., "trustedhost alice" and not
                    just "trustedhost"). Avoid establishing trust relationships with systems outside of the organization's security perimeter and/or
                    systems not controlled by the local administrative staff. Firewalls and other network security elements should actually block
                    rlogin/rsh/rcp access from external hosts.<htm:br/><htm:br/> Finally, make sure that .rhosts files are only readable by the owner
                    of the file (i.e., these files should be mode 600).<htm:br/></htm:p>

          <htm:code>/etc/ftpusers</htm:code> and <htm:code>/etc/vsftp.ftpusers</htm:code> contain a list of users who are not allowed to
                    access the system via WU-FTPd and vsftpd, respectively. Generally, only normal users should ever access the system via FTP-there
                    should be no reason for "system" type accounts to be transferring information via this mechanism. Certainly the root account
                    should never be allowed to transfer files directly via FTP.<htm:br/><htm:br/> If vsftpd is used, it may be desirable to reverse
                    the usage of the users file to be a list of users who ARE able to ftp to the server, instead of a list of users who are NOT able
                    to ftp into the server. This provides greater control and safety in denying the ftp usage by default for users NOT listed. To
                    reverse the meaning of the vsftpd users list file set <htm:code>userlist_deny=NO</htm:code> in the vsftpd.conf file. The script
                    above attempts to check for the <htm:code>userlist_deny</htm:code> vsftpd setting and will not create or modify the default vsftpd
                    user list file if the value is NO. It is important to carefully test your configuration after these changes to be sure that only
                    the expected users are allowed to login via ftp.<htm:br/></htm:p>

        <htm:p>X servers listen on port 6000/tcp for messages from remote clients running on other systems. However, X Windows uses a
                    relatively insecure authentication protocol and an attacker who is able to gain unauthorized access to the local X server can
                    easily compromise the system. Invoking the "-nolisten tcp" option causes the X server not to listen on port 6000/tcp by default.
                    This prevents authorized remote X clients from displaying windows on the local system as well. However, the forwarding of X events
                    via SSH will still happen normally. This is the preferred and more secure method transmitting results from remote X clients in any
                    event.<htm:br/></htm:p>

        <htm:p>Anonymous root logins should never be allowed, except on the system console in emergency situations. At all other times, the
                    administrator should access the system via an unprivileged account and use some authorized mechanism (such as the su command, or
                    the freely-available sudo package) to gain additional privileges. These mechanisms provide at least some audit trail in the event
                    of problems.<htm:br/><htm:br/> Many enterprises – who use serial port concentrators to connect to a server in a data center
                    without physically having to use the keyboard – consider the serial port a console. This is in keeping with the Unix server
                    tradition of controlling headless Unix machines using a serial port console. Just like the virtual consoles, this one needs
                    protected as well.

        <htm:p> By default on Debian Linux, you can enter single user mode simply by typing "linux single" at the LILO prompt or in the GRUB
                    boot-editing menu. Some believe that this is left in to ease support of users with lost root passwords. In any case, it represents
                    a clear security risk – authentication should always be required for root-level access. It should be noted that it is extremely
                    difficult to prevent compromise by any attacker who has knowledge, tools, and full physical access to a system. This kind of
                    measure simply increases the difficulty of compromise by requiring more of each of these factors.<htm:br/><htm:br/> These last two
                    items have attempted to address concerns of physical/boot security. To make these preparations more complete, one should consider
                    setting the BIOS to boot only from the main hard disk and locking this setting with a BIOS password. For more information on
                    reducing the threat posed by an attacker with physical/boot access, consider the article "Anyone with a Screwdriver Can Break In,"
                    available at <htm:a href="http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html">http://www.bastille-linux.org/jay/anyone-with-a-screwdriver.html</htm:a>.<htm:br/><htm:br/> Note: Even though this topic is
                    addressed by Bastille, it performs a step not executed by Bastille and should be completed even if Bastille was used. </htm:p>

                    "log server" systems, it should not be listening on 514/udp for incoming log messages as the protocol used to transfer these
                    messages does not include any form of authentication, so a malicious outsider could simply barrage the local system's Syslog port
                    with spurious traffic either as a denial-of- service attack on the system, or to fill up the local system's logging file systems

                        shell to a shell not in <htm:code>/etc/shells</htm:code>. They can even be deleted if the machines does not use the
                        daemon/service that each is responsible for, though it is safest to simply deactivate them as is done here. To deactivate
                        them, lock the password and set the login shell to an invalid shell. <htm:code>/dev/null</htm:code> is a good choice because
                        it is not a valid login shell, and should an attacker attempt to replace it with a copy of a valid shell the system will not
                        operate properly.</htm:p>

                        the account will be locked out after 7 days (-I 7). Finally, the instructions above set a minimum password length of 8

          <htm:br/>
          <htm:p>With a default umask setting of 077 – a setting agreed to as part of the consensus process with DISA and NSA – files and
                        directories created by users will not be readable by any other user on the system. The user creating the file has the
                        discretion of making their files and directories readable by others via the chmod command. Users who wish to allow their files
                        and directories to be readable by others by default may choose a different default <htm:code>umask</htm:code> by inserting the
                        umask command into the standard shell configuration files (.profile, .cshrc, etc.) in their home directories. A
                            <htm:code>umask</htm:code> of 027 would make files and directories readable by users in the same Unix group, while a umask
                        of 022 would make files readable by every user on the system.<htm:br/><htm:br/></htm:p>
          <htm:p>We adjust root's <htm:code>umask</htm:code> setting separately in this item, as root shells don't necessarily read the
                        system-wide configuration files. For example, root sessions using <htm:code>bash</htm:code> doesn't get
                        <htm:code>umask</htm:code> settings from /etc/profile.<htm:br/><htm:br/></htm:p>
          <htm:p>Note: This is been shown to cause problems with the installation of software packages where the installation script uses
                        the default umask – the directories are owned by root with 700 permissions, and then the application and/or daemon cannot read
                        its files. A simple fix to this problem is to manually issue a less restrictive umask (such as umask 022) for the shell
                        session doing the installation, or place such a umask command in the beginning to a less restrictive value before the
                        installation, or in the beginning of the installation script.<htm:br/><htm:br/></htm:p> There are of course special cases to
                    consider, for example the recommended umask setting of 077 interfers with the sftp and ftp users who need to have the web files
                    transferred be world readable and directories world searchable. Typically the umask setting needs to be 022 or occassionally 002
                    for sftp and ftp web transfer accounts. Typically the umask can be configured in the ftp server configuration file however for
                    sftp users, a patch is required for the sftp server before umask control is available. The patch is available as part of the
                    sftplogging patch <htm:a href="http://sftplogging.sourceforge.net/">http://sftplogging.sourceforge.net/</htm:a></htm:p>

    <cdf:title>Warning Banners</cdf:title>
    <cdf:description> Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of trespassers
            on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version information and other detailed
            system information from attackers attempting to target specific attacks at a system (though there are other mechanisms available for
            acquiring this information). Guidelines published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name
            of the organization that owns the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with
            local statutes, and that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. Clearly, the organization's local legal counsel and/or site
            security administrator should review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are
            inherently site-specific.<htm:br/> More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at <htm:a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/s&amp;sappendix2002.htm">http://www.usdoj.gov/criminal/cybercrime/s&amp;sappendix2002.htm</htm:a></cdf:description>

        <htm:br/> The default SMTP greeting string displays the version of the Sendmail software running
                on the remote system. Hiding this information is generally considered to be good practice, since it can help attackers target attacks
                at machines running a vulnerable version of Sendmail. However, the actions in the benchmark document completely disable Sendmail on
                the system, so changing this default greeting string is something of a moot point unless the machine happens to be an email server.

                and then never completing the process to open the connection. This leaves your system with several (hundreds or thousands) of
                half-open connections. This is a fairly simple attack and should be blocked. </cdf:description>

                be locked out after 3 successive failed login attempts. This value is chosen as it is a common value used in some Federally-regulated
                industries – you are free to increase it if desired.<htm:br/><htm:br/> Note: The above command assumes account lockouts are not
