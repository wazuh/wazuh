    BACKGROUND.
    
    The Center for Internet Security ("CIS") provides benchmarks, scoring tools, software, data, information, suggestions, ideas, and other services and materials from the CIS website or elsewhere ("Products") as a public service to Internet users worldwide.  Recommendations contained in the Products ("Recommendations") result from a consensus-building process that involves many security experts and are generally generic in nature.  The Recommendations are intended to provide helpful information to organizations attempting to evaluate or improve the security of their networks, systems, and devices.  Proper use of the Recommendations requires careful analysis and adaptation to specific user requirements.  The Recommendations are not in any way intended to be a "quick fix" for anyone's information security needs.
    
    NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, OR COVENANTS.
    
    CIS makes no representations, warranties, or covenants whatsoever as to (i) the positive or negative effect of the Products or the Recommendations on the operation or the security of any particular network, computer system, network device, software, hardware, or any component of any of the foregoing or (ii) the accuracy, reliability, timeliness, or completeness of  the Products or the Recommendations.  CIS is providing the Products and the Recommendations "as is" and "as available" without representations, warranties, or covenants of any kind.  
    
    USER AGREEMENTS.
    
    By using the Products and/or the Recommendations, I and/or my organization ("We") agree and acknowledge that:
    
    1.	No network, system, device, hardware, software, or component can be made fully secure;
    2.	We are using the Products and the Recommendations solely at our own risk;
    3.	We are not compensating CIS to assume any liabilities associated with our use of the Products or the Recommendations, even risks that result from 		CIS's negligence or failure to perform; 
    4.	We have the sole responsibility to evaluate the risks and benefits of the Products and Recommendations to us and to adapt the Products and the 			Recommendations to our particular circumstances and requirements;
    5.	Neither CIS, nor any CIS Party (defined below) has any responsibility to make any corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; or to notify us of 		the need for any such corrections, updates, upgrades, or bug fixes; and
    6.	Neither CIS nor any CIS Party has or will have any liability to us whatsoever (whether based in contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise) for 		any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (including without limitation loss of profits, loss of sales, loss of or damage 		to reputation,loss of customers, loss of software, data, information or emails, loss of privacy, loss of use of any computer or other equipment, 	business interruption, wasted management or other staff resources or claims of any kind against us from third parties) arising out of or in any way 	Connected with our use of or our inability to use any of the Products or Recommendations (even if CIS has been advised of the possibility of such 	damages), including without limitation any liability associated with infringement of intellectual property, defects, bugs, errors, omissions, 	viruses, worms, backdoors, Trojan horses or other harmful items.
    
    GRANT OF LIMITED RIGHTS.
    
    CIS hereby grants each user the following rights, but only so long as the user complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use:
    
    1.	Except to the extent that we may have received additional authorization pursuant to a written agreement with CIS, each user may download, install and 	use each of the Products on a single computer;
    2.	Each user may print one or more copies of any Product or any component of a Product that is in a .txt, .pdf, .doc, .mcw, or .rtf format, provided 		that all such copies are printed in full and are kept intact, including without limitation the text of this Agreed Terms of Use in its entirety.
    
    RETENTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; LIMITATIONS ON DISTRIBUTION.
    
    The Products are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and by international treaties.  We acknowledge and agree that we are not acquiring title to any intellectual property rights in the Products and that full title and all ownership rights to the Products will remain the exclusive property of CIS or CIS Parties.  CIS reserves all rights not expressly granted to users in the preceding section entitled "Grant of limited rights."
    Subject to the paragraph entitled "Special Rules" (which includes a waiver, granted to some classes of CIS Members, of certain limitations in this paragraph), and except as we may have otherwise agreed in a written agreement with CIS, we agree that we will not (i) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for any software Product that is not already in the form of source code; (ii) distribute, redistribute, encumber, sell, rent, lease, lend, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or exploit rights to any Product or any component of a Product; (iii) post any Product or any component of a Product on any website, bulletin board, ftp server, newsgroup, or other similar mechanism or device, without regard to whether such mechanism or device is internal or external, (iv) remove or alter trademark, logo, copyright or other proprietary notices, legends, symbols or labels in any Product or any component of a Product; (v) remove these Agreed Terms of Use from, or alter these Agreed Terms of Use as they appear in, any Product or any component of a Product; (vi) use any Product or any component of a Product with any derivative works based directly on a Product or any component of a Product; (vii) use any Product or any component of a Product with other products or applications that are directly and specifically dependent on such Product or any component for any part of their functionality, or (viii) represent or claim a particular level of compliance with a CIS Benchmark, scoring tool or other Product.  We will not facilitate or otherwise aid other individuals or entities in any of the activities listed in this paragraph.
    We hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold CIS and all of its officers, directors, members, contributors, employees, authors, developers, agents, affiliates, licensors, information and service providers, software suppliers, hardware suppliers, and all other persons who aided CIS in the creation, development, or maintenance of the Products or Recommendations ("CIS Parties") harmless from and against any and all liability, losses, costs, and expenses (including attorneys' fees and court costs) incurred by CIS or any CIS Party in connection with any claim arising out of any violation by us of the preceding paragraph, including without limitation CIS's right, at our expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to this indemnification, and in such case, we agree to cooperate with CIS in its defense of such claim.  We further agree that all CIS Parties are third-party beneficiaries of our undertakings in these Agreed Terms of Use. 
    
    SPECIAL RULES.
    
    CIS has created and will from time to time create, special rules for its members and for other persons and organizations with which CIS has a written contractual relationship.  Those special rules will override and supersede these Agreed Terms of Use with respect to the users who are covered by the special rules.
    CIS hereby grants each CIS Security Consulting or Software Vendor Member and each CIS Organizational User Member, but only so long as such Member remains in good standing with CIS and complies with all of the terms of these Agreed Terms of Use, the right to distribute the Products and Recommendations within such Member's own organization, whether by manual or electronic means.  Each such Member acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing grant is subject to the terms of such Member's membership arrangement with CIS and may, therefore, be modified or terminated by CIS at any time.
    CHOICE OF LAW; JURISDICTION; VENUE.
    
    We acknowledge and agree that these Agreed Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Agreed Terms of Use shall be filed only in the courts located in the State of Maryland, that we hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any such action.  If any of these Agreed Terms of Use shall be determined to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then such terms shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    
    BY USING THE PRODUCTS I(WE) ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE READ THESE AGREED TERMS OF USE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, UNDERSTAND THEM, AND I(WE) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THEM IN ALL RESPECTS.

    <title>Patches and Additional Software</title>
    <xccdf:description>
      <xhtml:p>Note that the items in this section involve downloading vendor patches and third-party 
        security software from external archive sites.  It is critical to always verify the integrity of 
        such software using file or package signatures (if provided) or at least MD5 checksums.  
        Failure to do so may result in the system being compromised by a “Trojan Horse” created 
        by an attacker with unauthorized access to the archive site.</xhtml:p>
      <xhtml:p>When downloading software packages and patches, always download the files to a non-
        world-writable directory.  Do not use a directory such as /tmp or /var/tmp which might 
        allow another user on the system to corrupt or interfere with the files being downloaded. </xhtml:p>

      <title>Apply latest OS patches</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:p>Keeping up-to-date with vendor patches is critical for the security and reliability of the system. Vendors issue
                    operating system updates when they become aware of security vulnerabilities and other serious functionality issues, but
                    it is up to their customers to actually download and install these patches. Sun's recommended patching strategy is
                    covered in the document "Solaris Patch Management: Recommended Strategy" available from <xhtml:a href="http://www.sun.com/blueprints/browsesubject.html#dcp.">http://www.sun.com/blueprints/browsesubject.html#dcp.</xhtml:a></xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p>During the cluster installation process, administrators may ignore individual patch installs that fail with either
                    return code 2 (indicates that the patch has already been installed on the system) or return code 8 (the patch applies to
                    an operating system package which is not installed on the machine). If a patch install fails with any other return code,
                    consult the patch installation log in /var/sadm/install_data.</xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p> Note that in addition to installing the Patch Clusters as described above, administrators may wish to also check
                    the Solaris [osrel].PatchReport file (available from the same FTP site as the patch clusters) for additional security or
                    functionality patches that may be required on the local system. Administrators are also encouraged to check the
                    individual README files provided with each patch for further information and post- install instructions. Automated tools
                    for maintaining current patch levels are also available, such as the Sun Patch Manager tool ("man smpatch" for more
                    info). </xhtml:p>
        <xhtml:p> Note that best practices recommend verifying the integrity of downloaded software and patches using file or
                    package signatures. Failure to do so may result in the system being compromised by a “Trojan Horse” created by an
                    attacker with unauthorized access to the archive site. Sun provides digital signatures for its patches (see <xhtml:a href="http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/spfaq">http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patches/spfaq</xhtml:a>). </xhtml:p>

      <title>Install SSH</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> OpenSSH is a popular free distribution of the standards-track SSH protocols, which allow secure encrypted
                    network logins and file transfers. However, compilation of OpenSSH is complicated by the fact that it is dependent upon
                    several other freely- available software libraries which also need to be built before OpenSSH itself can be compiled. In
                    order to simplify the installation process for Solaris 8 and earlier, we make use of a pre-compiled version of OpenSSH,
                    which is available in Solaris package format (the package contains 32-bit executables that should run on all releases of
                    Solaris from 2.5.1 onwards). This package is not required on Solaris 9 systems, since Sun is now distributing OpenSSH
                    with the Solaris operating system as of this release. For more information on building OpenSSH from source, see
                    www.openssh.com. Sun also publishes information on building OpenSSH for Solaris in its Blueprints series
                    (http://www.sun.com/security/blueprints/). </xhtml:div>

      <title>Disable standard services</title>
      <description>
        <xhtml:div>The stock /etc/inet/inetd.conf file shipped with Solaris contains many services which are rarely used, or which
                    have more secure alternatives. Indeed, after enabling SSH (see Item 1.3) it may be possible to completely do away with
                    all inetd- based services, since SSH provides both a secure login mechanism and a means of transferring files to and
                    from the system. In fact, the actions above will disable all standard services normally enabled in the Solaris
                    inetd.conf file. The rest of the actions in this section give the administrator the option of re-enabling certain
                    services—in particular, the services that are disabled in the last two loops in the "Action" section above. Rather than
                    disabling and then re-enabling these services, experienced administrators may wish to simply disable only those services
                    that they know are unnecessary for their systems. </xhtml:div>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> It is possible to run a Unix system with the Sendmail daemon disabled and still allow users on that system to
                    send email out from that machine. Running Sendmail in "daemon mode" (with the –bd command-line option) is only required

                    disabling the –bd option on the local mail server on Solaris 9 (or any system running Sendmail v8.12 or later) it is
                    also necessary to modify the /etc/mail/submit.cf file. Find the line that reads “D{MTAHost}localhost” and change
                    localhost to the name of some other local mail server for the organization. This will cause email generated on the local
                    system to be relayed to that mail server for further processing and delivery. Note that if the system is an email
                    server, the administrator is encouraged to search the Web for additional documentation on Sendmail security issues. Some

        <xhtml:div> Solaris 9 now includes the popular Open Source Samba server for providing file and print services to

        <xhtml:div> NFS is frequently exploited to gain unauthorized access to files and systems. Clearly there is no need to run
                    the NFS server-related daemons on hosts that are not NFS servers. If the system is an NFS server, the admin should take
                    reasonable precautions when exporting file systems, including restricting NFS access to a specific range of local IP
                    addresses and exporting file systems "read-only" and "nosuid" where appropriate. For more information consult the
                    share_nfs manual page. Much higher levels of security can be achieved by combining NFS with secure RPC or Kerberos,
                    although there is significant administrative overhead involved in this transition. Note that if the system is an NFS
                    server than the rpcbind process must also be running (see Item 7.2 below). </xhtml:div>

        <xhtml:div>While this action disables the standard NFS client processes (statd and lockd), it is important to note that it
                    is still possible for the superuser to mount remote file systems on the local machine via NFS. Starting with Solaris 9,
                    the administrator can completely disable NFS client access by removing the NFS client software packages (SUNWnfscr,
                    SUNWnfscu, and SUNWnfscx), but these packages will have to be re-installed if NFS is to be re-enabled at a later date.
                    Note that other file transfer schemes (such as rdist via SSH) can often be more secure than NFS for certain
                    applications, although again the use of secure RPC or Kerberos can significantly improve NFS security. Also note that if
                    the machine will be an NFS client, then the rpcbind process must be running (see Item 3.11 below). </xhtml:div>

      <title>Restrict core dumps to protected directory</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> By default core dump files are world-readable. Yet core dumps, particularly those from set-UID and set-GID
                    processes, may contain sensitive data that should not be viewed by all users on the system. The above action causes all
                    core dumps on the system to be written to a special directory that is only accessible by the superuser. Note that on
                    development workstations, this may make it difficult for developers to obtain core files for debugging without
                    administrative intervention. Core dumps tend to be large files and the contents of the /var/core directory can end up
                    rapidly consuming large amounts of disk space and possibly causing a denial of service attack on the system. It is a
                    good idea to monitor this directory on a regular basis and remove any unneeded core files. If the local site chooses,
                    dumping of core files can be completely disabled with the following command: "coreadm -d global -d global-setid -d
                    process -d proc-setid". Note that there is a bug in Solaris 7 and 8 that automatically re-enables per-process core dumps
                    during the reboot process. The only work-around at this time is to add a script to the system boot sequence that
                    explicitly runs "coreadm –d process". </xhtml:div>

    <title>Logging</title>
    <xccdf:description>
      <xhtml:p>The items in this section cover enabling various different forms of system logging in order 
        to keep track of activity on the system.  Tools such as Swatch 
        (http://www.oit.ucsb.edu/~eta/swatch/) and Logcheck 
        (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sentrytools/) can be used to 
        automatically monitor logs for intrusion attempts and other suspicious system behavior.  
        Note that these tools are not officially supported by Sun Microsystems.</xhtml:p>
      
      <xhtml:p>In addition to the local log files created by the steps in this section, it is also recommended 
        that sites collect copies of their system logs on a secure, centralized log server.  Not only 
        does centralized logging help sites correlate events that may be occurring on multiple 
        systems, but having a second copy of the system log information may be critical after a 
        system compromise where the attacker has modified the local log files on the affected 
        system(s).</xhtml:p>
      
      <xhtml:p>Because it is often necessary to correlate log information from many different systems 
        (particularly after a security incident) experts recommend establishing some form of time 
        synchronization among systems and devices connected to the local network.  The standard 
        Internet protocol for time synchronization is the Network Time Protocol (NTP), which is 
        supported by most network-ready devices.  More information on NTP can be found at 
        http://www.sun.com/security/blueprints/ and 
        http://www.ntp.org. </xhtml:p>

      <title>Turn on inetd tracing</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> If inetd is running, it is a good idea to make use of the "tracing" (-t) feature of the Solaris inetd that logs
                    information about the source of any network connections seen by the daemon. This information is logged via Syslog and by
                    default Solaris systems deposit this logging information in /var/adm/messages with other system log messages. Should the
                    administrator wish to capture this information in a separate file, simply modify /etc/syslog.conf to log daemon.notice
                    to some other log file destination (see Item 5.3 below). In addition to the information provided by inetd tracing, the
                    popular free PortSentry tool (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sentrytools/) can be used to monitor access attempts on
                    unused ports. Note that running PortSentry may result in the CIS testing tools reporting "false positives" for "active"
                    ports that are actually being held by the PortSentry daemon. Note that PortSentry is not officially supported by Sun
                    Microsystems. </xhtml:div>

                    Operating Environment published by Sun Microsystems as part of their "Blueprints On-Line" series contains additional
                    information on reducing the amount of logging produced by the "administrative" (ad) audit class (see
                    http://www.sun.com/security/blueprints/ for more details). Note that DoD installations have much more stringent auditing
                    requirements than those listed here. DoD guidelines require "flags:lo,ad,cc,fw,-fc,-fd,-fr" to be set in the
                    audit_control file. Note that "-fr" in particular can cause extremely large audit trails to be generated. </xhtml:div>

        <xhtml:div> It's critical to protect system log files from being modified by unauthorized individuals. Also, certain logs
                    contain sensitive data that should only be available to the system administrator. Most of the settings enforced here
                    reflect the standard Solaris default permissions. Note that sites using the runacct script for generating billing
                    reports and other data from the system process accounting logs will notice that the script incorrectly sets the mode on
                    the wtmpx file to 664 (adds the "group writability" bit). The local site may wish to "chmod g-w /var/adm/wtmpx" after
                    running the runacct script. </xhtml:div>

      <xhtml:p>File and directory permission control is one of the greatest challenges of secure system 
        administration. The system administrator can and should monitor and secure permissions 
        on system files and directories, but has little control over user-owned files and directories. 
        This section provides guidance on how to secure system files and directories, set secure 
        defaults for users and monitor file permissions.</xhtml:p>

      <description>
        <xhtml:div>A corrupted root file system is one mechanism that an attacker with physical access to the system console can use
                    to compromise the system. By enabling the "logging" option on the root file system, it is much more difficult for the
                    root file system to become corrupted at all, thwarting this particular type of attack. However, other sorts of attacks
                    are possible if the attacker has unrestricted physical access to the system. Be sure to keep critical systems in limited
                    access data centers or other restricted facilities. Note that the administrator may also wish to add the "logging"
                    option to other ufs type file systems in /etc/vfstab. This will help the system to reboot faster in the event of a crash
                    at the cost of some disk overhead (up to a maximum of 64MB per partition) for the file system transaction log file.

      <title>Remove .rhosts support in /etc/pam.conf</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> Used in conjunction with the BSD-style “r-commands” (rlogin, rsh, rcp), .rhosts files implement a weak form of
                    authentication based on the network address or host name of the remote computer (which can be spoofed by a potential
                    attacker to exploit the local system). Disabling .rhosts support helps prevent users from subverting the system’s normal
                    access control mechanisms. If .rhosts support is required for some reason, some basic precautions should be taken when
                    creating and managing .rhosts files. Never use the "+" wildcard character in .rhosts files. In fact, .rhosts entries
                    should always specify a specific trusted host name along with the user name of the trusted account on that system (e.g.,
                    "trustedhost alice" and not just "trustedhost"). Avoid establishing trust relationships with systems outside of the
                    organization's security perimeter and/or systems not controlled by the local administrative staff. Firewalls and other
                    network security elements should actually block rlogin/rsh/rcp access from external hosts. Finally, make sure that
                    .rhosts files are only readable by the owner of the file (i.e., these files should be mode 600). </xhtml:div>

        <xhtml:div> ftpusers contains a list of users who are not allowed to access the system via FTP. Generally, only normal users
                    should ever access the system via FTP—there should be no reason for “system” type accounts to be transferring
                    information via this mechanism. Certainly the root account should never be allowed to transfer files directly via FTP.
                    The file created by the action above is similar to the one that exists by default under Solaris. Consider also adding
                    the names of other privileged or shared accounts which may exist on your system such as user oracle and the account
                    which your Web server process runs under. </xhtml:div>

        <xhtml:div> By default the system logging daemon, syslogd, listens for log messages from other systems on network port

                    malicious outsider could simply barrage the local system's Syslog port with spurious traffic—either as a denial
                    -of-service attack on the system, or to fill up the local system's logging file systems so that subsequent attacks will
                    not be logged. Note that it is considered good practice to set up one or more machines as central "log servers" to
                    aggregate log traffic from all machines at a site. However, unless a system is set up to be one of these "log server"
                    systems, it should not be listening on 514/udp for incoming log messages. </xhtml:div>

      <title>Prevent X server from listening on port 6000/tcp</title>
      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> X servers listen on port 6000/tcp for messages from remote clients running on other systems. However, X Windows
                    uses a relatively insecure authentication protocol—an attacker who is able to gain unauthorized access to the local X
                    server can easily compromise the system. Invoking the "-nolisten tcp" option causes the X server not to listen on port
                    6000/tcp by default. This does prevent authorized remote X clients from displaying windows on the local system as well.
                    However, the forwarding of X events via SSH will still happen normally. This is the preferred and more secure method
                    transmitting results from remote X clients in any event. </xhtml:div>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> The RETRIES parameter is the number of failed login attempts a user is allowed before being disconnected from
                    the system and forced to reconnect. When LOCK_AFTER_RETRIES is set in /etc/security/policy.conf, then the user's account
                    is locked after this many failed retries (the account can only be unlocked by the administrator using the "passwd -u
                    &lt;username&gt; " command). Setting these values helps discourage brute force password guessing attacks. Note
                    that while the actions above set the lockout limit at 5, the US Department of Defense standard is even more restrictive,
                    allowing only 3 failures. Users at DoD facilities are required to use this more restrictive setting. Be careful when
                    enabling these settings as they can create a denial-of-service situation for legitimate users and applications. Account
                    lockout can be disabled for specific users via the usermod command. For example, "usermod -K lock_after_retries=no
                    oracle" would disable account lockout for the "oracle" account. </xhtml:div>

      <xccdf:description>
        <xhtml:div> It is a good idea to force users to change passwords on a regular basis. The commands above will set all active
                    accounts (except the root account) to force password changes every 91 days (13 weeks), and then prevent password changes
                    for seven days (one week) thereafter. Users will begin receiving warnings 28 days (4 weeks) before their password
                    expires. Sites also have the option of expiring idle accounts after a certain number of days (see the on-line manual
                    page for the usermod command, particularly the –f option). These are recommended starting values, but sites may choose
                    to make them more restrictive depending on local policies. Note that due to the fact that /etc/default/passwd sets
                    defaults in terms of number of weeks (even though the actual values on user accounts are kept in terms of days), it is
                    probably best to choose interval values that are multiples of 7. </xhtml:div>

    <title>Warning Banners</title>
    <xccdf:description> Presenting some sort of statutory warning message prior to the normal user logon may assist the prosecution of
      trespassers on the computer system. Changing some of these login banners also has the side effect of hiding OS version
      information and other detailed system information from attackers attempting to target specific attacks at a system. Guidelines
      published by the US Department of Defense require that warning messages include at least the name of the organization that owns
      the system, the fact that the system is subject to monitoring and that such monitoring is in compliance with local statutes, and
      that use of the system implies consent to such monitoring. Clearly, the organization’s local legal counsel and/or site security
      administrator should review the content of all messages before any system modifications are made, as these warning messages are
      inherently site- specific. More information (including citations of relevant case law) can be found at

      <xhtml:p>The items in this section are security configuration settings that have been suggested by 
        several other resources and system hardening tools.  However, given the other settings in 
        the benchmark document, the settings presented here provide relatively little incremental 
        security benefit.  Nevertheless, none of these settings should have a significant impact on 
        the functionality of the system, and some sites may feel that the slight security 
        enhancement of these settings outweighs the (sometimes minimal) administrative cost of 
        performing them.</xhtml:p>   
      <xhtml:p>None of these settings will be checked by the automated scoring tool provided with the 
        benchmark document.  They are purely optional and may be applied or not at the discretio
        of local site administrators. </xhtml:p>
