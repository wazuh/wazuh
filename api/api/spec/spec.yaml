  description: "The Wazuh API is an open source RESTful API that allows for interaction\
    \ with the Wazuh manager from a web browser, command line tool like cURL or any\
    \ script or program that can make web requests. The Wazuh Kibana app relies on\
    \ this heavily and Wazuh’s goal is to accommodate complete remote management of\
    \ the Wazuh infrastructure via the Wazuh Kibana app. Use the API to easily perform\
    \ everyday actions like adding an agent, restarting the manager(s) or agent(s)\
    \ or looking up syscheck details.\n"
