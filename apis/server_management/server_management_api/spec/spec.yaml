    The Wazuh API is an open-source RESTful API that allows for interaction with the Wazuh manager from a web browser,
    command line tools like cURL or any script or program that can make web requests. The Wazuh WUI relies on this
    heavily and Wazuh’s goal is to accommodate complete remote management of the Wazuh infrastructure via the Wazuh WUI.
    Use the Wazuh API to easily perform everyday actions like adding an agent or restarting the agent(s).

    # Authentication

    Wazuh API endpoints require authentication to be used. Therefore, all calls must include a JSON Web Token.
    JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting
    information between parties as a JSON object. Perform a call with `basicAuth` to `POST /security/user/authenticate`
    and obtain a JWT token to run any endpoint.

    JWT tokens have a default duration of 900 seconds. To change this value, you must perform a call with a valid
    JWT token to `PUT /security/config`. After this change, you will need to get a new JWT token as all previously
    issued tokens are revoked when any change is performed on security configuration.

    Login with USER and PASSWORD:

    `curl -u <USER>:<PASSWORD> -k -X POST "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/security/user/authenticate"`
    ```json
    {
        "data": {
            "token": "<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
        },
        "error": 0
    }
    ```
    Use the token from the previous response to perform any endpoint request:

    `curl -k -X <METHOD> "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/<ENDPOINT>" -H  "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"`

    Change the token base duration:

    `curl -k -X PUT "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/security/config" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
    -d '{"auth_token_exp_timeout": <NEW_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS>}'`
