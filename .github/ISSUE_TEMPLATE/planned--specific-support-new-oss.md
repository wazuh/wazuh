# Plan

<!-- Uncomment for QA issue
**QA**

## Considerations

- Testing environment: Deploy the new OS taking into account the following notes:
  - If the Wazuh central components are supported: 1 VM
  - If the Wazuh agent is supported: 1 VM for each architecture supported.
  - If the Wazuh central components or the Wazuh agent is not supported, deploy a Debian 12 VM for the non-supported component.
- All testing tasks must be completed for each OS architecture supported.
- The following tasks should be completed in order.

## Tasks

- [ ] Test the Wazuh dashboard one-liner deployment.
  - [ ] Deploy a Wazuh agent using the Wazuh dashboard one-liner feature provided in the Wazuh user interface with the following cases.
    - [ ] Only IP address.
    - [ ] Only FQDN.
    - [ ] IP address, agent name, and group.
- [ ] Add/Update/Check CI
  - [ ] Test the JobFlow testing tool for that specific system.
  - [ ] Add the OS and each architecture to the JobFlow testing tool.
  - [ ] Add the OS and each architecture to the GitHub Deployability and Upgrade release templates.
- [ ] Add the OS and its supported architectures to the E2E UX Tests spreadsheet (OS sheet).
- [ ] Add the OS as supported in the compatibility system spreadsheet.

**DevOps**
- [ ] **Central components**: Manually allocate two different accessible machines with the new OS. This is the first step for everything else.
- [ ] **No central components**: Deploy an All In One (in our featured OS, probably Amazon Linux) and allocate an accessible machine with the new OS to test the agent. This is the first step for everything else.
- [ ] **Central components**: Review/test the installation assistant using the new OS.
- [ ] Add support in the allocator.
- [ ] Adapt Puppet.
- [ ] Adapt Ansible.
- [ ] Update AMI, OVA, or Docker images if needed.

<!-- Uncomment for THREATINTEL issue
**ThreatIntel**
- [ ] Define a plan to support the new OS, particularly with regard to SCA policies. If there's no official CIS policy for that OS version, we either use an existing draft or we adapt a previous version.

<!-- Uncomment for AGENT issue
**Agent**

- [ ] Smoke test that the package works, including installation, upgrade, and its related tier functionality.
- [ ] Check the default settings of previous versions, and adapt them to the new OS version if necessary.
- [ ] Add support for the new OS to the GitHub Actions package builder.
